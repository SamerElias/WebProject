<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>To the reader, and especially to the critical
reader, it would seem but courteous to give at
the beginning of my book some indication of its
purpose. It makes no attempt to fill the place
either of a critical study or a definitive biography.
Though Whitman died thirteen years
ago, the time has not yet come for a final and
complete life to be written; and when the hour
shall arrive we must, I think, look to some
American interpreter for the volume. For Whitman&rsquo;s
life is of a strongly American flavour.
Instead of such a book I offer a biographical
study from the point of view of an Englishman,
yet of an Englishman who loves the Republic.
I have not attempted, except parenthetically
here and there, to make literary decisions on
the value of Whitman&rsquo;s work, partly because
he still remains an innovator upon whose case
the jury of the years must decide&mdash;a jury which
is not yet complete; and partly because I am
not myself a literary critic. It is as a man
that I see and have sought to describe Whitman.
But as a man of special and exceptional
character, a new type of mystic or seer. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[Pg viii]</span>
the conviction that he belongs to the order of
initiates has dragged me on to confessedly
difficult ground.</p>

<p>Again, while seeking to avoid excursions
into literary criticism, it has seemed to me to
be impossible to draw a real portrait of the
man without attempting some interpretation
of his books and the quotation from them of
characteristic passages, for they are the record
of his personal attitude towards the problems
most intimately affecting his life. I trust that
this part of my work may at any rate offer
some suggestions to the serious student of
Whitman. Since he touched life at many points,
it has been full of pitfalls; and if among them
I should prove but a blind leader, I can only
hope that those who follow will keep open
eyes.</p>

<p>Whitman has made his biography the more
difficult to write by demanding that he should
be studied in relation to his time; to fulfil
this requirement was beyond my scope, but I
have here and there suggested the more notable
outlines, within which the reader will supply
details from his own memory. As I have
written especially for my own countrymen, I
have ventured to remind the reader of some
of those elementary facts of American history
of which we English are too easily forgetful.</p>

<p>The most important chapters of Whitman&rsquo;s
life have been written by himself, and will be
found scattered over his complete works. To
these the following pages are intended as a
modest supplement and commentary. Already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>[Pg ix]</span>
the Whitman literature has become extensive,
but, save in brief sketches, no picture of his
whole life in which one may trace with any
detail the process of its development seems as
yet to exist. In this country the only competent
studies which have appeared are that
of the late Mr. Symonds, which devotes some
twenty pages to biographical matters, and the
admirable and suggestive little manual of the
late Mr. William Clarke. Both books are some
twelve years old, and in those years not a little
new material has become available, notably that
which is collected in the ten-volume edition of
Whitman&rsquo;s works, and in the book known as
<i>In re Walt Whitman</i>. On these and on essays
printed in the <i>Conservator</i> and in the <i>Whitman
Fellowship Papers</i> I have freely drawn for the
following pages.</p>

<p>Of American studies the late Dr. Bucke&rsquo;s
still, after twenty years, easily holds the first
place. Beside it stand those of Mr. John
Burroughs, and Mr. W. S. Kennedy. To these,
and to the kind offices of the authors of the
two last named, my book owes much of any
value it may possess. I have also been assisted
by the published reminiscences of Mr. J. T.
Trowbridge, Mr. Moncure Conway, and Mr.
Thomas Donaldson, and by the recently published
<i>Diary in Canada</i> (edited by Mr. Kennedy),
and Dr. I. H. Platt&rsquo;s Beacon Biography of the
poet.</p>

<p>Since I never met Walt Whitman I am
especially indebted to his friends for the personal
details with which they have so generously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
furnished me: beside those already named, to
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Johnston, Mr. J. Hubley
Ashton, Mrs. W. S. Kennedy, Mrs. E. M.
Calder, Mr. and Mrs. (Stafford) Browning of
Haddonfield (Glendale), Mr. John Fleet of
Huntington, Captain Lindell of the Camden
Ferry, and to Mr. Peter G. Doyle; but especially
to Whitman&rsquo;s surviving executors and
my kind friends, Mr. T. B. Harned and Mr.
Horace Traubel. To these last, and to Mr.
Laurens Maynard, of the firm of Messrs. Small,
Maynard &amp; Co., the publishers of the final
edition of Whitman&rsquo;s works, I am indebted for
generous permission to use and reproduce photographs
in their possession. I also beg to make
my acknowledgments to Mr. David McKay and
Mr. Gutekunst, both of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Helpful suggestions and information have
been most kindly given by my American friends,
Mr. Edwin Markham, Professor E. H. Griggs,
Mr. Ernest Crosby, Dr. George Herron, Professor
Rufus M. Jones of Haverford, Mr. C.
F. Jenkins of Germantown, and Mr. and Mrs.
David Thompson of Washington. Mr. Benjamin
D. Hicks of Long Island has repeatedly replied
to my various and troublesome inquiries
as to the Quaker ancestry of Walt Whitman,
and Dr. E. Pardee Bucke has furnished me with
an admirable sketch of his father Dr. R. M.
Bucke&rsquo;s life and the photograph which I have
reproduced. In England also there are many
to whom I would here offer my most grateful
thanks. And first, to Mr. Edward Carpenter,
whose own work has always been my best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
guides in the study of Whitman&rsquo;s, and whose
records of his interviews with the old poet in
Camden have given me more insight into his
character than any other words but Whitman&rsquo;s
own. He has also read the MS., and aided
me by numberless suggestions. Mrs. Bernard
Berenson, who for some years enjoyed the old
man&rsquo;s friendship, has supplied me with an invaluable
picture of his relations with her father,
the late Mr. Pearsall Smith, and his family,
and has generously lent me various letters in
her possession, and permitted me to make reproductions
from them. Mr. J. W. Wallace,
of the &ldquo;Bolton group,&rdquo; has allowed me to read
and use his manuscript description of a visit
to Camden in 1891; and another of the same
brotherhood, Dr. J. Johnston, whose admirable
account of a similar series of interviews in the
preceding year is well known by Whitman
students, has supplied me with a photograph
of the little Mickle Street house as it then was.</p>

<p>To Mr. William M. Rossetti and to Mr.
Ernest Rhys I am indebted for valuable suggestions;
and for similar help to my friends,
Professor W. H. Hudson and Messrs. Arthur
Sherwell, B. Kirkman Gray and C. F. Mott.
Finally, the book owes much more than I can
say to my wife.</p>

<p>While gratefully acknowledging the assistance
of all these and others unnamed, I confess that
I am alone responsible for the general accuracy
of my statements, and the book&rsquo;s point of view,
and I wish especially to relieve the personal
friends of Whitman from any responsibility for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span>
the hypothesis relating to his sojourn in the
South, beyond what is stated in the Appendix.
To all actual sins of commission and omission
I plead guilty, trusting that for the sympathetic
reader they may eventually be blotted out in
the light which, obscured though it be, still
shines upon my pages from the personality of
Walt Whitman.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p class="center">WHITMAN&rsquo;S AMERICA</p>



<p class="p2">The men of old declared that the lands of
adventure lay in the West, for they were bold
to follow the course of the sun; and to this
day the bold do not look back to seek romance
behind them in the East.</p>

<p>Whether this be the whole truth or no, such
is the notion that comes upon the wind when,
journeying westward in mid-Atlantic, you begin
to know the faces on ship-board, and to understand
what it is that is in their eyes. Strange
eyes and foreign faces have these voyagers&mdash;dwellers
upon Mediterranean shores, peasants
from the borders of the Baltic, or dumb inhabitants
of the vast eastern plains, huddled
now together in the ship. But in them is a
hope which triumphs over the misery of the
present as it has survived the misery of the
past, and to-day that hope has a name, and is
America. For America is indeed the hope of
the forlorn and disinherited in every land to
whom a hope remains. From the ends of the
earth they set out, and separated from one
another by every barrier of race and language,
meet here upon the ocean, having nothing in
common but this hope, this dream which will
yet weld them together into a new people. For
the comfortable dreamer there is Italy and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a>[Pg xx]</span>
Past, but for many millions of the common people
of Europe and of Italy herself&mdash;and the common
people too have their dream&mdash;America, the land
of the Future, is the Kingdom of Romance.</p>

<p>Nor to these only, but, as I think, to every
traveller not unresponsive to the genius of the
land. For it is the genius of youth&mdash;youth
with its awkward power, its incompleteness, its
promise. And the home of this genius must
be the land not only of progress and material
achievement, but also of those visions which
haunt the heart of youth. America is more than
the golden-appled earthly paradise of the poor,
it is a land of spiritual promise. And more
perhaps than that of any nation the American
flag is to-day the symbol of a Cause, and of a
Cause which claims all hearts because ultimately
it is that of all Peoples.</p>

<p>And America has another claim to be regarded
as truly romantic. Hers is the charm of novelty.
It is not the glamour of the old but of the new,
and the perennially new. Some four centuries
have passed since the days of Columbus, centuries
which have dimmed the lustre of many another
adventurous voyage into dull antiquity, but
America is still the New World, and the exhilarating
air of discovery still breathes as fresh
in the West as on the first morning.</p>

<p>With that discovery there dawned a new
historic day whose sun is not yet set. We instinctively
put back the beginning of our own
era to the time of Elizabeth, that Virgin Queen
in whose colony of Virginia the American people
was first born, to grow up into maturity under
its statesmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a>[Pg xxi]</span></p>

<p>And if we see but vaguely in the greyest
hours of our dawn the figure of the Discoverer,
while beyond him all seem strange as the men
of yesterday&mdash;if we behold our own sun rising
on the broad Elizabethan hours&mdash;how fitting it
is that the New World should be peopled by
those who still retain most of the temper of
that generous morning! The American of
to-day with his thirst for knowledge, his versatility,
his quick sense of the practicable, his
delight in the doing of things, his directness
and frankness of purpose, his comradeship and
hospitality, his lack of self-consciousness&mdash;with
all the naïve inconsistencies, the amiable
braggings, the mouthings of phrases, and the love
of praise which belong to such unconsciousness
of self&mdash;with his glowing optimism, his belief in
human nature, his faith and devotion to his
ideals&mdash;the American of to-day is in all these
things the Elizabethan of our story. America
is the supreme creation of Elizabethan genius&mdash;its
New World, to which even that world which
we call &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; must give place.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The Romance of America is not only new, it
is like a tale that is being told for the first time
into our own ears. And like some consummate
story whose chapters, appearing month by month,
hold us continually in expectant suspense, its
plot is still evolving and its characters revealing
themselves, so that as yet we can only guess at
its <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>I call it a Romance, for it is indeed a tale
of wonder; but unlike the old romances its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a>[Pg xxii]</span>
bold realism is not always beautiful. The style
of its telling is often loud, its words blunt, its
rhythm strange and full of changes. But it has
a large Elizabethan movement which cannot be
denied. Denounce and deprecate as we will,
all that is young in us responds to it. The story
carries us along, at times by violence and in our
own despite, but so a story should. It may
be the end will justify and explain passages
that to-day are but obscure: no story is complete
until the end, and America has not yet
been told. It is still morning there: and the
heart of it is still the heart of youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The unprejudiced and candid visitor will be
provoked to criticism by much that he sees in
the United States; but even his criticism will
be prompted by the possibilities of the country.
It is this sense of its possibilities which captures
the imagination, and fills the mind with the
desire to do&mdash;to correct, it may be&mdash;but in any
case to do.</p>

<p>The incentive to action is felt by everyone,
American or immigrant, and dominates all. Here
for the first time one seems to be, as it were,
in a live country, among a live people whose
work is actually under its hand and must occupy
it for years to come. In England things are
different; the country does not so audibly challenge
the labourer to till and tame it. It does
not say so plainly to every man&mdash;<i>I want you:
here is range and scope for all your manhood</i>.
Only the seer can read that word written
pathetically across all this English countryside
whose smooth air of completion conceals so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"></a>[Pg xxiii]</span>
blank a poverty. In America the very stones cry
out, and all who run must read. And thus the
whole American atmosphere is that of action.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Chinese, that most practical of peoples,
have an old saying that the purpose of the
true worship of heaven is to spiritualise the
earth. It is a reminder that materialism and
mysticism should go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Now the American is often, and not unjustly,
accused of sheer materialism. But by temper
he is really an idealist. The very Constitution
of the United States, not to mention the famous
<i>Declaration</i>, is no less transcendental than the
<i>Essays</i> of Emerson, nor less weighty with deep
purpose than the speeches of Lincoln. All these
are characteristic utterances of the American
genius; they have been attested by events, and
sealed in the blood of a million citizen soldiers.</p>

<p>And how, one may ask, could the citizens
of a State which more than any other manifestly
depends for its life upon communion in an ideal
be other than idealists? Gathered from every
section of the human race, this people has
become a nation through its consciousness of
a Cause; its members being possessed not of
a common blood, tradition or literature, but of
a purpose and idea sacred to all. If then the
national life depends upon the living idealism
of the people, the actual unquestionable vigour of
this national life may be taken as evidence of
the strength of that idealism. But, on the other
hand, the nation&rsquo;s present pre-occupation with
its merely material success conceals the gravest
of all its perils, because it threatens the very
principle of the national life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"></a>[Pg xxiv]</span></p>

<p>Thus held together by its future, and not as
seem most others, by their past, the American
nation has been slow in coming to self-consciousness,
slow therefore in producing an original or
national art. Hitherto it has been occupied with
its own Becoming; and to-day, to virile Americans,
America remains the most engrossing of occupations,
the noblest of all practicable dreams.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Renaissance has here attempted
a task far graver than in Medician
Florence or Elizabethan London: to create,
namely, not so much a new art as a new race.
It has here to achieve its incarnation not in
line and colour, not in marble nor in imperishable
verse, but in the flesh and blood of a
nation gathered from every family of Man.
And for that, it is forever assimilating into
itself scions of every European people, and transforming
them out of Europeans into Americans.</p>

<p>Vast as such a process is, the assimilation
of all their surging aspirations and ideals into
one has been hardly less vast. It is little
wonder then that America has been slow in
coming to self-consciousness. What is wonderful
is her organic power of assimilation. And
now there begin to be evidences in American
thought of a spiritual synthesis, the widest
known. As yet they are but vague suggestions.
But they seem to indicate that when an
American philosophy takes the field it will be
pragmatical in the best sense; too earnestly
concerned with conduct and with life to be careful
of symmetry or tradition; directed towards
the future, not the past. It will be a philosophy
of possibilities founded upon the study of an
adolescent race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv"></a>[Pg xxv]</span></p>

<p>It seemed natural to preface this study of
Whitman with a sketch of the American genius.
Doubtless that genius has other aspects than
those here presented, and to some of these, later
pages will bear witness; but the impression I
have attempted to reproduce is at least taken
from life. It is, moreover, not unlike that of
Whitman himself as presented in his first
Preface, and is even more suggestive of the
America of his youth than that of his old age.</p>

<p>Every thinker owes much to his time and
race, and Whitman more than most. He always
averred that the story of his life was bound
up with that of his country, and took significance
from it. To be understood, the man must be
seen as an American. As a Modern, we might
add, for the story of his land is so brief.</p>

<p>Dead now some thirteen years, and barely
an old man when he died, his personal memory
seemed to embrace nearly the whole romance.
His grandfather was acquainted with old Tom
Paine, whose <i>Common Sense</i> had popularised
the Republican idea in the very hour of American
Independence: he himself had talked with
the soldiers of Washington, and as a lad<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he
had met Aaron Burr who killed the glorious
Hamilton, sponsor for that Constitution which
when Whitman died was but a century old.</p>

<p>In the seven decades of his life the American
population had multiplied near seven-fold, and
had been compacted together into an imperial
nation. It seemed almost as though he could
remember the thirteen poor and jealous States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"></a>[Pg xxvi]</span>
with their conflicting interests and traditions,
their widely differing climates, industries and
inhabitants, separated from one another by vast
distances&mdash;and how they yielded themselves
reluctantly under the hand of Fate to grow
together in Union into the greatest of civilised
peoples; while central in the story of his life
was that Titanic conflict whose solemn bass accompaniment
toned and deepened loose phrases
and popular enthusiasms into a national hymn.</p>

<p>Himself something of a poet&mdash;how much we
need not attempt to estimate&mdash;he did continual
homage to that greater Poet, whose works
were at once his education and his library&mdash;the
genius of America. None other, ancient
or mediæval, discoursed to his ear or penned in
immortal characters for him to read, rhythms
so large and pregnant. It was the prayer and
purpose of his life that he might contribute
his verse to that great poem; and his life is
like a verse which it is impossible to separate
from its context. That he understood, and
even in a sense re-discovered America, can
scarcely be denied by serious students of his
work. I believe that the genius of America will
in time discover some essential elements of herself
in him, and will understand herself the
better for his pages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Belonging thus to America as a nation, the
earlier scenes of Walt Whitman&rsquo;s story are
fitly laid in and about metropolitan New York.
It was not till middle life and after the completion
and publication of what may be regarded
as the first version of his <i>Leaves of Grass</i>&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii"></a>[Pg xxvii]</span>
edition that is to say of 1860&mdash;that he removed
for a while to the Federal capital where,
throughout the War, the interest of America
was centred. Afterwards he withdrew to
Camden, into a sort of hermitage, midway
between New York and Washington.</p>

<p>Though his heart belonged to the West, the
Far West never knew him. Both north and
south, he wandered near as widely as the limits
of his States. He knew the Mississippi, the
Great Lakes, and the Rocky Mountains; but
all that vast and wonderful country which
reaches west from Colorado towards Balboa&rsquo;s
sea was untrodden by his feet. A circle
broadly struck from the actual centre of population,
and taking in Denver, New Orleans,
Boston and Quebec, includes the whole field
of his wanderings within a radius of a thousand
miles. He was not a traveller according to our
modern use of the word; he had never lost
sight for many hours of the shores of America;
even Cuba and Hawaii were beyond his range.</p>

<p>But he had studied nearly all the phases
of life included in the Republic. His birth
and breeding in the &ldquo;middle States&rdquo; gave him
a metropolitan quality which neither New England
nor the South could have contributed. Of
peasant stock, himself an artizan and always
and properly a man of the people, he was of
the average stuff of the American nation; and
his everyday life&mdash;apart from the central and
exceptional fact of his individuality&mdash;was that
of millions of unremembered citizens. Whitman
was not only an American type, he was also
a type of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii"></a>[Pg xxviii]</span></p>

<p>The typical American is not city born.
Rapidly as that sinister fate is overtaking the
Englishman, the native American is still of
rural birth.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And, as we have said, Whitman
was of the average; he was born in Long
Island of farming folk.</p>

<p>But he was a modern, and the modern movement
throughout the world is citywards. Everywhere
the Industrial Revolution is destroying the
economy of our ancestors and creating another;
diverting all the scattered energy which springs
out of the countryside into the great reservoirs
of city life, there to be employed upon new
tasks.</p>

<p>Modern life is the life of the town, and for
many years it was Whitman&rsquo;s life. But again
every town depends for its vitality and wealth
upon the countryside. The city is a mere
centre, factory and exchange. It cannot live
upon itself. It handles everything but produces
none of all that raw material from which everything
that it handles is made. Especially is
this true of the human stuff of civilisation.
Men are only shaped and employed in cities&mdash;they
are not produced there. The city uses
and consumes the humanity that is made in
the fields. And Whitman, who was drawn into
the outskirts of the metropolis as a child, and
as a young man entered into its heart, was
born among wide prospects and shared the
sane life of things that root in the earth. He
was the better fitted to bear and to correlate
all the fierce stimuli of metropolitan life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">THE WHITMANS OF WEST HILLS</p>


<p class="p2">The old writers<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> tell how Long Island was once
the happy hunting ground of wolves and Indians,
the playing place of deer and wild turkeys; and how
the seals, the turtles, grampuses and pelicans loved its
long, quiet beaches. Seals and whales are still occasional
visitors, and its coasts are rich in lore of wrecks,
of pirates and of buried treasure.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago it could boast of hamlets only
less remote from civilisation than are to-day the villages
of that other &ldquo;Long Island&rdquo;&mdash;the group of the Outer
Hebrides&mdash;which, for an equal distance, extends along
the Scottish coast from Butt of Lewis to Barra Head.
The desultory stage then occupied a week on the double
journey between Brooklyn and Sag Harbour. Beyond
the latter, Montauk Point thrusts its lighthouse some
fifteen miles out into the Atlantic breakers. Here the
last Indians of the island lingered on their reservation,
and here the whalers watched for the spouting of their
prey in the offing.</p>

<p>A ridge of hills runs along the island near the northern
shore, rising here and there into heights of three or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
four hundred feet which command the long gradual
slope of woods and meadows to the south, with the
distant sea beyond them; to the north, across the
narrow Sound, rises the blue coast line of Connecticut.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is on the slopes below the highest of these points
of wide vision that the Whitman homestead lies, one of
the pleasant farms of a land which has always been
mainly agricultural. Large areas of the island are
poor and barren, covered still with scrub and &ldquo;kill-calf&rdquo;
or picturesque pine forest, as in the Indian days.
But the land here is productive.</p>

<p>From the wooded head of Jayne&rsquo;s Hill behind the
farm, the township of Huntington stretches to the
coast where it possesses a harbour. It was all purchased
from the Indians in 1653, for six coats, six
bottles, six hatchets, six shovels, ten knives, six fathom
of wampum, thirty muxes, and thirty needles.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
Indians themselves do not seem to have caused much
anxiety to the settlers; but a generation later, it is recorded
that in a single year no fewer than fifteen of the
wolves, which they had formerly kept half-tamed, were
killed by the citizens of Huntington.</p>

<p>The next troublers of the peace were the British
troops. For here, a century later, during the last years
of the War of Independence, Colonel Thompson of His
Majesty&rsquo;s forces pulled down the Presbyterian Church,
and with its timbers erected a fortress in the public
burying-ground, his soldiers employing the gravestones
for fire-places and ovens.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> They seem to have occupied
another meeting-house as a stable. Such are the everyday
incidents of a military occupation; arising out of
them, claims to the amount of £7,000 were preferred
against the colonel by the township; but he withdrew
to England, where, as Count Rumford, he afterwards
became famous upon more peaceful fields.</p>

<p>In Whitman&rsquo;s childhood, Huntington was, as it still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
remains, a quiet country town of one long straggling
street. It counted about 5,000 inhabitants, many of
them substantial folk, and in this was not far behind
Brooklyn. In those days the whole island could not
boast 60,000 people. But if they were few, they were
stalwart. The old sea-going Paumànackers were a
rough and hardy folk, and travellers remarked the frank
friendliness of the island youth.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Inter-racial relations seem upon the whole to have
been good; the Indians being treated with comparative
justice, and the negro slaves well cared for. Between
the Dutch and the English there was friction in the
early years. Long Island, or Paumanok&mdash;to give it the
most familiar of its several Indian names<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;had been
settled by both races; the Dutch commencing on the
west, opposite to their fortress and trading station of
New Amsterdam (afterwards New York), and the English,
at about the same time, upon the east. They met
near West Hills, and Whitman had the full benefit of
his birth upon this border-line, Dutch blood and English
being almost equally mingled in his veins.</p>

<p>As to the Dutch of Long Island, they were marked
here as elsewhere by sterling and stubborn qualities.
There is a reserve in the Dutch nature which, while
it tends to arouse suspicion in others, makes it the
best of stocks upon which to graft a more emotional
people. Slow, cautious, conservative, domestic, practical,
they have formed a bed-rock of sound sense and phlegmatic
temper, not for Long Island only, but for the
whole of New York State, where, till the middle of the
eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> they were predominant. Perhaps
no other foundation could have adequately supported
the superstructure of fluctuating and emotional elements
which has since been raised upon it.</p>

<p>The Dutch homesteads of the island were famous for
their simple, severe but solid comfort, their clean white
sanded floors, their pewter and their punches. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
such a home came Whitman&rsquo;s mother. She was a van
Velsor of Cold Spring, which lies only two or three
miles west of the Whitman farm. Her father, Major
Cornelius van Velsor, was a typical, burly, jovial, red-faced
Hollander.</p>

<p>But Louisa, his daughter, was not wholly Dutch, for
the major&rsquo;s wife was Naomi Williams, of a line of
sailors, one of that great Welsh clan which counted
Roger Williams among its first American representatives.
Naomi was of Quaker stock.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Quakers appear early in the story of the island,
whose settlement was taking place during the first years
of their world-wide activity. Within a quarter of a
century of the first purchase of land from the Indians,
an English Quaker, Robert Hodgson,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was arrested in a
Long Island orchard for the holding of a conventicle.
He was carried to New Amsterdam, cruelly handled,
and imprisoned there.</p>

<p>In 1663, John Bowne,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> an islander of some standing
who had joined the Friends, was arrested and transported
to Holland, there to undergo his trial for heresy.
This was in the period when the district was under
Dutch control. A year later this came to an end, and
when, in 1672, George Fox preached under the oaks
which stood opposite to Bowne&rsquo;s house<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> at Flushing,
and again from the granite rock in the Oyster Bay
cemetery, he seems to have been met by no opposition
more serious than that which was offered by certain
members of his own Society.</p>

<p>We read<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of the settlement of a group of substantial
Quaker families near the village of Jericho, where they
built themselves a place of worship in 1689; and here,
a century later, lived Elias Hicks, perhaps the ablest
character, as he was the most tragic figure, in the story
of American Quakerism. He was a friend of Whitman&rsquo;s
paternal grandfather, and thus from both parents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
boy inherited something either of the blood or the tradition
of that Society which, directly or indirectly, gave
some of the noblest of its leaders to the nation. Such
men, for instance, as William Penn, Thomas Paine, and,
indirectly, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The earliest of the Whitmans of whom there appears
to be any record is Abijah, apparently an English
yeoman farmer in the days of Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> His two
sons sailed west in 1640 on the <i>True-Love</i>. One of
these, Zechariah, became a minister in the town of
Milford, Connecticut, and sometime before Charles II.
was crowned in the old country,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Joseph, Zechariah&rsquo;s
son, had crossed the Sound and settled in the neighbourhood
of Huntington. Either he or his successor
seems to have purchased the farm at West Hills, where
Walt Whitman was afterwards born; and in 1675
&ldquo;Whitman&rsquo;s hollow&rdquo; is mentioned as a boundary of
the township.</p>

<p>The garrulous histories of Long Island have little to
tell us of the family. One of Joseph&rsquo;s great-grandsons
was killed in the battle of Brooklyn,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that first great
fight between the forces of England and her rebellious
colonies, when in 1776 Howe and his Hessians drove
Putnam&rsquo;s recruits back upon the little town. Lieutenant
Whitman was one of those who fell on that day
before Washington could carry the remnant of his
troops across the East River under the friendly shelter
of the fog.</p>

<p>Another great-grandson, Jesse, married the orphan
niece of Major Brush, also a &ldquo;dangerous rebel&rdquo; who
suffered in the British prison of &ldquo;the Provost&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
Brushes, Williamses and Whitmans all seem to have
served in the armies of Independence, and one at least
of their women would have cut a figure in the field.
For Jesse&rsquo;s mother was large-built, dark-complexioned,
and of such masculine manners and speech that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
seemed to have been born to horses, oaths and tobacco.
As a widow she readily ruled her slaves, surviving to a
great age. In contrast with her, Jesse&rsquo;s wife, who also
displayed remarkable ability, was a natural lady.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> She
had been a teacher, and was a woman of judgment.
Perhaps Jesse himself was of gentler character than his
terrible old mother; he had leanings towards Quakerism,
and was a friend and admirer of Elias Hicks.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> So too
was Walter, the father of Walt, and one of Jesse&rsquo;s many
sons.</p>

<p>Born in 1789&mdash;the year in which the amended Constitution
of the United States actually came into force&mdash;Walter
grew up into a silent giant,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> a serious solid man,
reserved and slow of speech, kindly but shrewd and obstinate;
capable too, when he was roused, of passion.
He was a wood-cutter and carpenter, a builder of frame-houses
and barns, solid as himself. He learnt his trade
in New York, and afterwards wandered from place to
place in its pursuit. For a time after his marriage in
1816, he appears to have lived at West Hills, probably
farming a part, at least, of the lands of his fathers.
Their old house had recently been replaced by another
at a little distance. This is still standing, and here,
three years later, his second son was born. The child
was called after his father, but the name was promptly
clipped, and to this day he remains &ldquo;Walt.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 587px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="587" height="800" alt="Picture of Walt's mother, Louisa (van Velsor) Whitman at sixty." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">LOUISA (VAN VELSOR) WHITMAN AT SIXTY</p></div>
</div>

<p>His mother,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Louisa van Velsor, was a well-made,
handsome young woman, now in her twenty-fourth
year. Fearless, practical and affectionate, hers was a
strong and happy presence, magnetic with the potency
of a profound nature, as large and attractive as it was
without taint of selfishness. She seemed to unite in
herself the gentle sweetness and restraint of her Quaker<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
mother, with the more heroic, full-blooded qualities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
the old jolly major. She had a natural gift of description
and was a graphic story-teller, but of book-learning
she had next to none, and letter-writing was always
difficult to her. She lacked little, however, of that higher
education which comes of life-long true and fine relations
with persons and with things. She had been an excellent
horsewoman, and in later years her visitors were
impressed by her vitality and reserve power. Her words
fell with weight; she had a grave dignity; but withal
her oval face, framed in its dark hair and snowy cap,
was full of kindness; and about the corners of her
mouth, and under her high-set brows, there always
lurked a quaint and quiet humour. Little as we know
of Louisa Whitman, we know enough to regard her as
in every respect the equal in character of her son, whom
she endowed with a natural happiness of heart. She
became the mother of eight children, and lived to be
nearly eighty years old, somewhat crippled by rheumatism,
but industrious, charming and beloved to the last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first four years of his life, little Walt spent at
West Hills. He is not the only worthy of the place,
for here, half a century earlier, was born the Honourable
Silas Wood,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> who now and for ten years to come, represented
the district in Congress. Already, doubtless, he
was collecting materials for his <i>Sketch of the First Settlement
of Long Island</i>, soon to appear.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But neither he
nor his history greatly concerns us.</p>

<p>Some two or three miles of sandy lane separate the
old Whitman farm from the present railway station.
On an autumn day one finds the way bordered by
huckleberries and tall evening primroses, yellow toad-flax,
blue chickory and corn-flowers, and sturdy forests
of golden-rod among the briars and bushes. In the
rough hedgerows are red sumachs, oaks, chestnuts and
tall cedars, locusts and hickories; the gateways open on
to broad fields full of picturesque cabbages, or the plumed
regiments of the tall green Indian corn. It is a farming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
country, and a country rich in game&mdash;foxes and quails
and partridges&mdash;and populous now with all kinds of
chirping insects, with frogs and with mosquitoes. The
wooded hills themselves are full of birds; beyond them
there are vineyards.</p>

<p>The road winds to the hills which give the place its
name. To be precise, the Whitman farm, as my driver
assured me, belongs to the hamlet of Millwell, but the
title of West Hills is better known. The other name
may, however, serve to recall those cold sweet springs
which rise along the foot of the hills and keep the
country green, and whose waters are highly esteemed
in New York.</p>

<p>The lane passes by the end of an old grey shingled
farmhouse, boasting a new brick chimney. A delicate,
ash-like locust tree stands by the big gate.</p>

<p>Here, if you turn into the farm road under the boughs
of the orchard, and then, through the wicket in the
palings, cross the weedy garden square, you may enter
under the timber-propped porch into the low-ceiled house
where Walt was born. It is small but comfortable, of
two stories and a half. The morning sun streams
through the open door, blinks in at the sun-shutters,
and filters through the mosquito netting. On the left
of the hall<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are a bedroom and parlour, and the dining-room
is on the right, where a wing of one story has
been added. Beyond this there is a lower extension;
and beyond again, extend the chocolate-coloured barns
and sheds and byres and stables of the farm. At one
corner of the garden palings stands the little well-house
with its four neat pillars, and a big bell swings in its
forked post by the side gate to summon the men from
the fields into which one sees the farm road wandering.
The fields run up to the wood. Across the road from
the garden is an apple orchard, where the pigs root, and
the hens scratch and cluck and scuffle. It was planted
by Walt&rsquo;s uncle Jesse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 720px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="720" height="600" alt="Picture of Walt's birthplace at West Hills, 1904." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN&rsquo;S BIRTHPLACE AT WEST HILLS, FROM THE LANE, 1904</p></div>
</div>

<p>This is not the first ancestral cabin of the Whitmans;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
that lies at a little distance, nearer to the woods. It
belongs now to another farm&mdash;the former holding
having been divided&mdash;and the old cabin has become a
waggon-shed. Both farms have long since passed out
of the family; but near the first house, on a little woody
knoll,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> you may still see the picturesque group of unlettered
stones which cluster on the Whitman burying
hill.</p>

<p>Neither Walt himself nor his father and mother are
buried here among their relatives and ancestors; but
the boy, so early pre-occupied with the mysteries of life,
must have often stolen to this strange solitude to commune
with its silence and to hear the wind among the
branches, whispering of death. There is a big old oak
near by, old perhaps as the first Whitman settlement,
and a grove of beautiful black walnuts, and this, too,
was one of the children&rsquo;s haunts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such was the old Whitman home and country, to
which the boy&rsquo;s earliest memories belonged, where he
spent some of the years and nearly all the holidays of
his youth and early manhood, and in which his later
thoughts found their natural background, his deepest
consciousness its native soil. It is, as we have seen, no
tame or narrow country, but wide and generous, and it
is within sound of the sea. In the still night that succeeds
a storm, you may hear the strange low murmur
of the Atlantic surf beating upon the coast.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The boy
was born in the hills, with that sea-murmur about him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">BOYHOOD IN BROOKLYN</p>


<p class="p2">The hill-range which forms the back-bone of Long
Island, and upon whose slopes Walt Whitman
was born, terminates on the west in Brooklyn Heights,
which overlook the busy bay and crowded city of New
York.</p>

<p>The heights recall Washington&rsquo;s masterly retreat;
and the hint is enough to remind the shame-faced
English visitor that the American is not without cause
for a certain coolness in the very genuine affection which
he manifests for the mother country. &rsquo;Seventy-six and
the six years that followed, with all their legacy of
bitter thoughts, was succeeded by 1814 and the burning
of the Capitol. In this later war it was Virginia, not
New England, that took the initiative; Massachusetts
and Connecticut even opposed it, and it may have been
none too popular in adjacent Long Island.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Major van Velsor or his sons
actually took the field against the British. But this
second and last of the Anglo-American wars was still a
bitter and vivid memory when in May, 1823,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> towards
Walt&rsquo;s fourth birthday, his father, the old major&rsquo;s son-in-law,
left the farm, removing with his family to Front
Street, Brooklyn, near the wharves and water-side.</p>

<p>Though but a country town with great elm-trees still
shading its main thoroughfare,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Brooklyn was growing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
and its trade was brisk. It is likely that the carpenter,
Whitman, framed more than one of the hundred and
fifty houses which were added to it during the year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Walt took advantage of his improved
situation to study men and manners in a sea-port
town. He watched the ferry-boats that for the
last ninety years had plied to and fro, binding Brooklyn
to its big neighbour opposite upon Manhattan Island.
For another sixty years their decks provided the only
roadway across the East River, and they still go back
and forward loaded heavily, in spite of the two huge
but graceful bridges which now span the grey waters.
The boy gazed wondering at the patient horse in the
round house on deck, which, turning like a mule at a
wheel-pump, provided the propelling power for the ferry-boat
till Fulton replaced him by steam.</p>

<p>The boy in frocks must have wondered, too, at the
great shows and pageants of 1824 and 1825 which filled
New York with holiday-making crowds. For in August
of the former year, came the old hero of two Republics,
General Lafayette, to be received with every demonstration
of admiring gratitude by the people of America.
Some scintilla of the glory of those days&mdash;pale reflection,
as it was, of the far-away tragic radiance that lighted up
the world at the awakening of Justice and of Liberty on
both sides of the sea&mdash;fell upon the child. For when the
old soldier visited Brooklyn to lay the corner-stone of a
library there, he found the youngster in harm&rsquo;s way and
lifted him, with a hearty kiss, on to a coign of vantage.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Thus, at six years old, Walt felt himself already famous.</p>

<p>Again, a few months later, the city was all ablaze with
lights and colour and congratulations on the opening of
the Erie Canal, which connected New York with Ohio
and promised to break the monopoly of Western commerce
held hitherto by the queen city of the Mississippi.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By this time, the family counted four children; two
brothers, Jesse and Walt, and two little girls, Mary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
Hannah, all born within six years. Of the children,
Walt and Hannah appear to have been special friends,
but we have little record of this period. As they grew
old enough, they attended the Brooklyn public school
and went duly to Sunday school as well.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In the
summers they spent many a long holiday in the fields
and lanes about West Hills.</p>

<p>A reminiscence of those times is enshrined in one of
the best known of the <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> written more
than a quarter of a century later, a memory of the May
days when the boy discovered a mocking-birds&rsquo; nest containing
four pale green eggs, among the briars by the
beach, and watched over them there from day to day
till presently the mother-bird disappeared; and then of
those September nights when, escaping from his bed, he
ran barefoot down on to the shore through the windy
moonlight, flung himself upon the sand, and listened to
the desolate singing of the widowed he-bird close beside
the surf. There, in the night, with the sea and the
wind, he lay utterly absorbed in the sweet, sad singing
of that passion, some mystic response awakening in
his soul; till in an ecstasy of tears which flooded his
young cheeks, he felt, rather than understood, the world-meaning
hidden in the thought of death.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>This self-revealing reminiscence, even if it should
prove to diverge from historic incident and to take
some colour from later thought, illumines the obscurity
which covers the inner life of his childhood. Elsewhere
we can dimly see him as his mother&rsquo;s favourite; towards
her he was always affectionate. But with his father he
showed himself wayward, idle, self-willed and independent,
altogether a difficult lad for that kindly but taciturn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
and determined man to manage. Walt retained these
qualities, and they caused endless trouble to every ill-advised
person who afterwards attempted the task in
which worthy Walter Whitman failed.</p>

<p>Among his young companions, though he was not
exactly imperious, Walt seems to have played the part
of a born leader; he was a clever boy; he always
had ideas, and he always had a following. And as a
rule he was delightful to be with, for he had an unflagging
capacity for enjoyment and adventure.</p>

<p>But there must have been times when he was moody
and reserved. The passionate element in his nature
which the song of the mocking-bird aroused belongs
rather to night solitudes than to perpetual society and
sunshine. As he grew older, and, perhaps, somewhat
overgrew his physical strength,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> he was often unhappy
in himself. There was something tempestuous in him
which no one understood, he himself least of any. Probably
his wise and very human mother came nearest to
understanding; and her heart was with him as he fought
out his lonely battles with that strange enemy of Youth&rsquo;s
peace, the soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little brothers were added from time to time to the
family group; Andrew, George and Jeff, and last of all
poor under-witted Ted, born when Walt was a lad of
sixteen, to be the life-long object of his mother&rsquo;s affectionate
care. The names of Andrew and Jeff reflect
their father&rsquo;s political sentiments; the latter recalling
the founder of the old Jeffersonian Republicanism; and
the former being called after Andrew Jackson, the
popular and successful candidate for the presidency, in
the year of the boy&rsquo;s birth, who afterwards reorganised
his party, creating the &ldquo;Democratic&rdquo; machine to take
the place of what had hitherto been the &ldquo;Republican&rdquo;
caucus. Thus Republicanism changed its name, and the
title did not reappear in party politics for a generation.</p>

<p>As Walter Whitman built, mortgaged and eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
sold his frame-houses, the family would often move
from one into another: we can trace at least five migrations<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
during the ten years that they remained in
Brooklyn. He was a busy, but never a prosperous man;
with his large family, the fluctuations of trade must
have affected him seriously; and scattered through his
son&rsquo;s story, there are fast-days and seasons of privation.
Walter Whitman was, in short, a working man
upon the borders of the middle-class: thrifty, shrewd,
industrious, but dependent upon his earnings; mixing at
times with people of good education, but of little himself;
a master-workman, the son of a well-read and
thoughtful mother, living in the free and natural social
order which at that time prevailed in Brooklyn and New
York.</p>

<p>He was not outwardly religious; he was never a
church-goer; even his wife, who called herself a Baptist,
only went irregularly,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and then, with an easy tolerance,
to various places of worship&mdash;the working mother of
eight children has her hands full on Sundays. In the
household there was no form of family prayers. But
when old Elias Hicks<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> preached in the neighbourhood,
they went to hear him, tending more towards a sort of
liberal Quakerism than to anything else.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WALTER WHITMAN, SENIOR</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Whitmans were not an irreligious family&mdash;Walt
was, for instance, fairly well-grounded in the Scriptures&mdash;but
they thought for themselves, they disliked
anything that savoured of exclusion, and their religion
consisted principally in right living and in kindliness.
Their devotion to the old Quaker minister is interesting.
Hicks was a remarkable man and a most powerful and
moving preacher. He was large and liberal-minded; too
liberal, it would seem, for some of his hearers. His
utterances had however passed unchallenged till an
evangelical movement, fostered by some English Friends
among their American brethren, made further acquiescence
seem impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>That which complacently calls itself orthodoxy is
naturally intolerant, it can, indeed, hardly even admit
tolerance to a place among the virtues; and the evangelical
propaganda must be very pure if it is to be unaccompanied
by the spirit of exclusion. It may seem
strange that such a spirit should enter into a Society
which gathers its members under the name of &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo;
a name which seems to indicate some basis broader than
the creeds, some spiritual unity which could dare to
welcome the greatest diversity of view because it would
cultivate mutual understanding. But the broader the
basis and the more spiritual the bond of fellowship, the
more disastrous is the advent of the spirit of schism
masking itself under some title of expediency, and here
this spirit had forced an entrance.</p>

<p>Between Hicks&mdash;who himself appears to have been
somewhat intolerant of opposition, a strong-willed man,
frankly hostile to the evangelical dogmatics&mdash;and the
narrower sort of evangelicals, relations became more and
more strained, until, in 1828, the octogenarian minister
was disowned by the official body of Quakers, after some
painful scenes. He was however followed into his exile
by a multitude of his hearers and others who foresaw
and dreaded the crystallisation of Quakerism under some
creed.</p>

<p>Soon after the crisis, and only three months before
his death, Elias Hicks preached in the ball-room of
Morrison&rsquo;s Hotel on Brooklyn Heights. Among the
mixed company who listened on that November evening
to the old man&rsquo;s mystical and prophetic utterance,
was the ten-year old boy, accompanying his parents.</p>

<p>Hicks sprang from the peasant-farming class to which
the Whitmans belonged; and, as a lad, had been intimate
with Walt&rsquo;s great-grandfather, and with his son
after him. It was then, with a sort of hereditary reverence,
that the boy beheld that intense face, with its
high-seamed forehead, the smooth hair parted in the
middle and curling quaintly over the collar behind; the
hawk nose, the high cheek bones, the repression of the
mouth, and the curiously Indian aspect of the tall com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>manding
figure, clad in the high vest and coat of
Quaker cut. The scene was one he never forgot. The
finely-fitted and fashionable place of dancing, the officers
and gay ladies in that mixed and crowded assembly,
the lights, the colours and all the associations, both of
the faces and of the place, presenting so singular a contrast
with the plain, ancient Friends seated upon the
platform, their broad-brims on their heads, their eyes
closed; with the silence, long continued and becoming
oppressive; and most of all, with the tall, prophetic
figure that rose at length to break it.</p>

<p>With grave emphasis he pronounced his text: &ldquo;What
is the chief end of man?&rdquo; and with fiery and eloquent
eyes, in a strong, vibrating, and still musical voice, he
commenced to deliver his soul-awakening message. The
fire of his fervour kindled as he spoke of the purpose of
human life; his broad-brim was dashed from his forehead
on to one of the seats behind him. With the power
of intense conviction his whole presence became an overwhelming
persuasion, melting those who sat before him
into tears and into one heart of wonder and humility
under his high and simple words.</p>

<p>The sermon itself has not come down to us. In his
<i>Journal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Hicks has described the meeting as a &ldquo;large and
very favoured season.&rdquo; It seems to have been devoid of
those painful incidents of opposition which saddened so
many similar occasions during these last years of his
ministry.</p>

<p>The old man had been accused of Deism, as though
he were a second Tom Paine and devotee of &ldquo;Reason&rdquo;:
in reality his message was somewhat conservative and
essentially mystical. A hostile writer<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> asserts truly
that the root of his heresy&mdash;if heresy we should call it&mdash;lay
in his setting up of the Light Within as the primary
rule of faith and practice. He always viewed the Bible
writings as a secondary standard of truth or guide to
action; as a book, though the best among books. And
as a book, it was the &ldquo;letter&rdquo; only: the &ldquo;spirit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
giveth life&rdquo; even to the letter, was in the hearts of
men.</p>

<p>In his attitude toward the idea of Christ, he distinguished,
like many other mystics, between the figure
of the historic Jesus of Nazareth and that indwelling
Christ of universal mystical experience, wherewith according
to his teaching, Jesus identified himself through
the deepening of his human consciousness into that of
Deity. In the mystical view, this God-consciousness is
in some measure the common inheritance of all the
saints, and underlies the everyday life of men. And
to it, as a submerged but present element in the life
of their hearers, Fox and the characteristic Quaker
preachers have always directed their appeal, seeking to
bring it up into consciousness. Once evoked and recognised,
this divine element must direct and control all
the faculties of the individual. It is the new humanity
coming into the world.</p>

<p>Hicks recognised in Jesus the most perfect of initiates
into this new life; and as such, he accorded a special
authority to the Gospel teachings, but demanded that
they should be construed by the reader according to
the Christ-spirit in his own heart. Properly understood,
the doctrine of the Inner Light is not, as many
have supposed it to be, the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of
individual eccentricity. On the contrary it tends to a
transcendental unity; for the spirit whose irruption
into the individual consciousness it seeks and supposes,
is that spirit and light wherein all things are united and
in harmony. In this sense, the Quaker preacher was
appealing to the essence of all social consciousness&mdash;that
realisation of an organic fellowship-in-communion
which the sacraments of the churches are designed to
cultivate.</p>

<p>However dark his great subject may appear to the
trained gaze of philosophy, the old man&rsquo;s words brought
illumination to the little boy. The sense of human
dignity was deepened in him; he breathed an air of
solemnity and inspiration.</p>

<p>Hicks died early in the new year, and with him there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
probably fell away the last strong link which held the
Whitmans to Quakerism. But the seed of the ultimate
Quaker faith&mdash;that faith by which alone a quaint little
society rises out of a merely historic and sectarian interest
to become a symbol of the eternal truths which
underlie Society as a whole, a faith which declares of its
own experience that Deity is immanent in the heart of
Man&mdash;this seed of faith was sown in the lad&rsquo;s mind to
become the central principle around which all his after
thought revolved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although, as these incidents make evident, Walt&rsquo;s
nature was strongly emotional, he never went through
the process known as conversion. Religion came to
him naturally. Responsive from his childhood to the
emotional influence of that ultimate reality which we
call &ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;the spiritual,&rdquo; he can never have had
the overwhelming sense of inward disease and degradation
which conversion seems to presuppose. Well-born
and surrounded by wholesome influences, it is probable
that the higher elements of his nature were always
dominant. The idea of abject unworthiness would
hardly be suggested to his young mind. He was not
ignorant of evil, insensible to temptation, or innocent
of those struggles for self-mastery which increase with
the years of youth. We have reason to believe that he
was wilful and passionate; though he was too affectionate
and too well-balanced to be ill-natured. Harmonious
natures are not insensitive to their own discordant
notes, and the harmony of Whitman held many discords
in solution.</p>

<p>He had then in his own experience, even as a child,
material sufficient for a genuine sense of sin. But this
sense, never, so far as we know, became acute enough to
cause a crisis in his life, never created in his mind any
feeling of an irreparable disaster, or any discord which
he despaired of ultimately resolving. He had not been
taught to regard God as a severe judge, of incredible
blindness to the complexity of human nature;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
perhaps partly in consequence of this, he was ever a
rebel against the Divine Justice.</p>

<p>There is, it may be said, another kind of conversion,
a turning of the eyes of the soul to discover the actual
presence and power of God at hand: the sequel may
show whether Whitman felt himself to be ignorant of
this change.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Honest, upright and self-respecting, his parents never
took an ascetic view of morality. They did not share
in that puritanical hostility to art and to amusements
which too long distorted the image of truth in the
mirror of Quakerism. Even as a lad, Walt discovered
those provinces of the world of romance which lie across
the footlights, and in the dazzling pages of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and, as a youth, he followed the wizard of
Waverley through all his stories and poems, becoming,
soon after Sir Walter&rsquo;s death, the happy possessor of
Lockhart&rsquo;s complete edition, in a solid octavo volume of
1,000 pages. From this time forward he was an insatiable
novel-reader, especially devoted to Fenimore
Cooper, who was then delighting the younger generation
with stories of pioneer life.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the
boy&rsquo;s life at this time was all amusement. At eleven
years of age he was in a lawyer&rsquo;s office,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> proud in the
possession of a desk and window-corner of his own.
The master found him a bright boy and was kind to
him, forwarding his limited education a step further.
He also subscribed on his behalf to a circulating library
which supplied the lad with a continuous series of tales.
But for whatever reason&mdash;one fears it was not unconnected
with those stories&mdash;Walt soon found himself
running errands for another master.</p>

<p>In his thirteenth year he was put to the printing
trade, and ceased, at least for a while, to live under his
father&rsquo;s roof.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The mother was out of health for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
time, during the period of the youngest son&rsquo;s birth and
infancy, and when in 1832 the town was visited by a
severe epidemic of cholera, the Whitman family removed
into the country. But Walt stayed behind,
boarding with the other apprentices of the Brooklyn
postmaster and printer. Mr. Clements and his family
were good to the lad while he was with them, and some
effusions of his&mdash;for like other clever boys he was writing
verses&mdash;appear to have found their way into the <i>Long
Island Patriot</i>.</p>

<p>From the <i>Patriot</i> he soon removed to the <i>Star</i>, another
local weekly, whose proprietor, Mr. Alden J. Spooner,
was a principal figure in the Brooklyn of those days,
and who long retained a vivid memory of a certain idle
lad who worked in his shop. If he had been stricken
with fever and ague, he used to say laughing, the boy
would have been too lazy to shake.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At thirteen, Walt
was too much interested in watching things to take
kindly to work; most of his time was spent in learning
what the world had to teach him; but in the end he
learnt his trade as well.</p>

<p>No place could have been better chosen to awake his
interest in the many-sided life around him than a
printing office, the centre of all the local news. Here
he developed fast in every way, shot up long and stalky,
scribbled for the press as well as learning his proper
business, and became a very young man about town.
Already, he felt the attraction of the great island city of
Mannahatta, where, according to its earliest name, for
ever &ldquo;gaily dash the coming, going, hurrying sea-waves.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>New York had for a time been crippled by the collapse
of American trade which followed the close of the
Napoleonic wars in Europe,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> but had recovered again,
and was now growing rapidly&mdash;a city of perhaps
200,000 inhabitants, the English element predominating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
in its curiously mixed population. Though it was
prosperous, it had its share of misfortune. Serious riots&mdash;racial,
religious and political&mdash;were not infrequent.
Epidemics of cholera swept through it; and in December,
1835, thirteen acres of its buildings were burnt out in a
three days&rsquo; conflagration.</p>

<p>In spite of these disasters the town grew and extended,
and means of locomotion multiplied. The stages were
running on Broadway from Bowling Green to Bleecker
Street, that is about half-way to Central Park, and the
great thoroughfare was crowded with traffic, presenting
a scene busier even and certainly more picturesque than
that of to-day. Fashionable folk still lived &ldquo;down
town&rdquo; below the present City Hall, in a district now
given up as exclusively to offices and warehouses as is
the City of London. Ladies took their children down
to play upon the open space of the Battery, looking
down the beautiful bay; and did their shopping at the
various Broadway stores. Upon their door-steps, on
either side of the street, citizens still sat out with their
families through the summer evenings; they condescended
to drink at the city pumps, and to buy hot-corn
and ices from the wayside vendors, while the height
of diversion was to run with the engine to some fire.
In a word, New York life was still natural and democratic;
palaces and slums were as unknown to the
democracy of the metropolis as the sky-scrapers which
render the approach to-day, in spite of its wooded hills,
its ships and islands, among the least beautiful of the
great sea-ports of the world.</p>

<p>Of diversions the citizens had no lack, for the population
was now sufficient to support a good native stage
and to attract foreign artists. The year 1825 saw the
advent of Italian opera at the Old Park theatre, which
stood not far from the present Post Office; and Garcia
and Malibran appeared in the &ldquo;Barber of Seville&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It
was here that Edwin Forrest was first seen by a New
York audience; while fashionable English actors like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
Macready and the Kembles were among its visitors. But
even more interest centred in the Bowery, the great
popular theatre built to seat 3,000, where the elder
Booth and Forrest played night after night before
enthusiastic houses of young and middle-aged artisans
and mechanics capable of thunderstorms of applause.</p>

<p>There were other theatres, too, such as Niblo&rsquo;s and
Richmond Hill, and to all of these young Whitman
presently found his way armed with a pressman&rsquo;s pass.
He must have spent many an evening in the city while
he was still working for Mr. Spooner, and one unforgettable
night, when he was fifteen or so, he was present
at a great benefit in the Bowery when Booth played
&ldquo;Richard III.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Fifty years later, the scene of that
evening remained as clear before his eyes as when he
sat in the front of the pit, hanging on every word and
gesture of that consummate actor. Inflated and stagy
his manner might be; but he revealed to the lad, watching
his studied abandonment to passion, a new world of
expression. For the first time, he understood how far
gestures, and a presence more powerful than words, can
express the heights and depths of emotion.</p>

<p>On that night in the Bowery, as upon those memorable
nights on the Long Island Beach, and in Morrison&rsquo;s
Ballroom, Walt came face to face with one of the
supreme mysteries. On these occasions it had been the
mystery of Death, which alone brings peace to the heart
of passionate love, and the mystery of the Immanent
Deity; now it was that other equal mystery, the mystery
of Expression, the utterance of the soul in living
words and acts and vivid presence. Love and Religion
were already significant to him; he had now been
shown the meaning of Art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime he had begun, as boys will, to take
an interest in politics. And before going further, we
must glance at the outstanding events and tendencies
of the period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Those two famous documents, <i>The Declaration of
Independence</i> and the <i>Constitution of the United States</i>,
are associated respectively with Thomas Jefferson and
Alexander Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and represent two currents of
political theory which beat against one another through
subsequent years. Jefferson was saturated with the
political idealism of the school of Rousseau, which
sums itself up in the demand for individual liberty and
rights, the declaration of individual independence, and
freedom from interference.</p>

<p>Hamilton on the other hand&mdash;who was by temper an
aristocrat, and once at a New York dinner described the
people as &ldquo;a great beast,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>&mdash;was possessed by the idea
of the Nation; he dwelt upon the duty of each member
to the whole, promulgating doctrines of solidarity and
unity in the cause of a common freedom. The two
views are, of course, complementary; their antagonism,
if it gave the victory to either, would be fatal to both;
and their reconciliation is essential to the life of the
Republic. But between their supporters, antagonism
has naturally existed.</p>

<p>The ideal of the Jeffersonian Republicans became
associated with popular or &ldquo;Democratic&rdquo; sentiment,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
standing as it did in opposition to the more conservative
and constitutional position of the Hamiltonian Federalists.
For a time the two parties dwelt together in such
amity that the Federalists were actually merged with
the Republicans; but the uncontested election of Monroe
was a signal for the outbreak of the old contest. At the
next <span class="correction" title="In the original book: election,[53] Adams">election,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> an Adams</span> of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Massachussetts">Massachusetts</span> was returned
to the White House; and Jackson of Tennessee, one
of the defeated candidates, built up a Democratic party
of opposition whose organising centre was New York.
On the other side, the followers of Adams and his secretary,
Henry Clay, came eventually to be known as
Whigs, &ldquo;Republican&rdquo; ceasing for a quarter of a century
to be a party label.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>The titles of the parties serve approximately to indicate
their different tendencies; though it must be remembered
that the Whiggery of Adams was coloured by
New England idealism, while the material interests of
the South turned their energies to capture the naturally
idealistic Democracy of Jackson. Eventually the division
became almost a geographical one; though certain of
her interests and perhaps her jealous antipathy to New
England, gave New York&rsquo;s sympathies to the South.</p>

<p>In 1832, when Walt was studying the world through
the keen eyes of thirteen, and the windows of a Brooklyn
printing shop, Democratic South Carolina was offering
a stubborn resistance to the Federal tariff. Theoretically,
and one may add ethically, any tariff was contrary
to the Jeffersonian doctrine of universal freedom; and
practically, it was disastrous to the special interests of
the South. Carolina, under the poetic fire and genius of
Calhoun, was the Southern champion against Northern,
or, let us say, Federal aggression. She stood out for the
rights of a minority so far as to propose secession. The
South was aggrieved by the tariff, for, roughly speaking,
its States were cotton plantations, whose interests lay
in easy foreign exchange; they grew no corn, they made
no machinery, they neither fed nor clothed themselves.
The North on the other hand was industrial, anxious to
guard its infant manufactures against the competition
of Great Britain. The West was agricultural, demanding
roads and public works which required the funds provided
by a tariff. Now even these public works, these
high roads and canals, were calculated directly to benefit
the Northern manufacturers rather than the planters of
the South whose highway to the West was the great
river which had formerly given them all the Western
trade to handle, and whose cheapest market for machinery
and manufactured goods lay over the high sea
whither its own staple was continually going.</p>

<p>The tariff imposed for the benefit of the Northern
section was, then, opposed by the South on grounds of
industrial necessity as well as of political theory. And it
may be noted the argument of the Southerner was equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
the argument of many an artisan in the metropolis, who
saw in free trade the sole guarantee of cheap living.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus there was a certain antagonism between the interests
of the two geographical sections of the American
nation; and this was emphasised by another cause
for hostility. Every statesman knew that, although
unacknowledged, it was really the question of slavery
which was already dividing America into &ldquo;North&rdquo; and
&ldquo;South&rdquo;. And recognising it as beyond his powers of
solution, he sought by maintaining a compromise to
conceal it from the public mind.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sovereign States,&rdquo; momentarily united for defence
against a domineering king, had at the same hour
been swept by Tom Paine&rsquo;s and Jefferson&rsquo;s versions of
the French Republicanism, and North and South alike
adhered to a doctrinaire equality. The negro, they were
willing to agree, should be voluntarily and gradually
emancipated.</p>

<p>But the hold of this policy on the South was soon
afterwards undermined by the economic development
which followed the introduction of the cotton-gin. The
new and rapidly growing prosperity of the planter depended
on the permanence of the &ldquo;institution&rdquo;. And
from this time forward the Southern policy becomes
hard to distinguish from the vested interests of the
slave-owner. The prosperity of the South seemed to
depend upon the extension of the cotton industry: the
cotton industry, again, upon slave-labour; thus it was
argued, the institution of slavery was necessary to the
prosperity of the South. The North, so the Southerner
supposed, had its own interests to serve, and only regarded
the South as a market. It was, he felt, jealous
of the dominance of Southern statesmanship in the
Union; and its desire to destroy &ldquo;the institution&rdquo; was
denounced as the sectional jealousy of small-minded,
shop-keeping bigots, of inferior antecedents. By the
brute force of increasing numbers, by a vulgar love of
trade, and the accidents of climate and of mineral resources,
the North was beginning to establish its hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
upon Congress, and arrogating to itself the Federal
power.</p>

<p>Hitherto, with the exception of the Adamses and of
Jackson, every President had been of Virginian birth,
bred, the Southerner declared, in the broader views of
statesmanship. But the North was now predominant
in the House of Representatives, and a balance could only
be preserved in the Senate, where each State appoints
two members, by constant watchfulness. Thus the
rapid settling of the middle West by Northerners must
be balanced by the annexation of new cotton-growing
regions in the South-west. The famous Missouri Compromise
of 1821 fixed the frontier between future free-soil
and slave States at the line of the southern boundary
of Missouri, while admitting that State itself into the
Union as a member of the latter class. Hence it was
only in the South-west that slavery could develop, and
extension by conquest of cotton territory became henceforward
an object of Southern politicians.</p>

<p>While, then, it was the aggression of the South which
finally drove the nation into civil war, the South for
many years had viewed itself as an aggrieved partner in
the inter-State compact, victimised in the interests of
the majority. It felt, perhaps not unjustly, that it was
being overridden, and that the Federation was becoming
what Jefferson described as &ldquo;a foreign yoke&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> It became
excessively sensitive to hostility: every rumour
of the spread of Abolition sentiment in the North&mdash;a
sentiment which favoured a new attitude towards the
Federal power, and would give control to it over the
domestic affairs of what hitherto had literally been
&ldquo;Sovereign States&rdquo;&mdash;raised a storm of indignation and
evoked new threats of secession.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But while slavery was already playing its part in
American politics it had not yet become the main line of
party cleavage. Although the party of free trade and of
State rights was the party of the South, it was not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
the party of slavery. It was still throughout America
the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s party,&rdquo; and the slave power was the last
to desire that it should cease to hold that title, especially
in the North. For many a year to come there would
be stout Abolitionists who could call themselves Democrats;
while &ldquo;dough-faces,&rdquo; or politicians who served
the party of slavery, were always to be found amongst
the Whigs.</p>

<p>Even while party feeling ran high, the increase of the
means of communication and the introduction of steam
transport, both on land and water, favoured the larger
Federal sentiment and quickened the national consciousness.
Talk of secession had been heard in New
England as well as in South Carolina; but actual
secession became more difficult as the manufacturers
of the East, the cotton-growers of the South, and the
farmers of the Mississippi basin had tangible evidence
of the many interests and privileges which were common
to them, and beheld more and more clearly the future
upon which America was entering. Year by year the
idea of the Union gained in vitality; and in spite of
party feeling, President Jackson had a nation behind
him when he refused to yield to South Carolina&rsquo;s threat
of secession.</p>

<p>A compromise was effected, and Carolina submitted
to the collection of duties under a somewhat mitigated
tariff: the relation of the constituent States to the
Federal power remaining still undefined, waiting, for
a generation to come, upon the growth of national sentiment
on the one hand, and the accumulation of resentment
upon the other.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">TEACHER AND JOURNALIST</p>


<p class="p2">The spring of 1836 found Whitman in New York.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>He was in his seventeenth year, had now learnt
his trade, and had begun to write for the weekly papers;
among others, contributing occasionally to the handsome
and aristocratic pages of the <i>Mirror</i>, perhaps the
best of its class.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> He lived in that journalistic atmosphere
which encourages expression and turns many a
clever lad into a prig. Walt was self-sufficient, but
there was nothing of the prig<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in him. Limited as his
schooling had been, he was naturally receptive and
thoughtful, and his education went steadily forward;
he made friends with older men, and with men of
education from whom he learnt much. And now he
became a teacher.</p>

<p>He was a healthy boy, but had somewhat overgrown
his strength, and perhaps this was among the causes of
his leaving the city in May, and going up Long Island
into the country. He joined his family for awhile, who
were living at Norwich;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and subsequently settled for
the winter as a country teacher at Babylon, boarding
round, as was the custom, in the homes of his various
pupils.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="800" height="589" alt="Another picture of Walt's birthplace from a different point of view, 1904." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN&rsquo;S BIRTHPLACE FROM THE FARM-YARD, 1904</p></div>
</div>

<p>The little town of Babylon stands on the swampy
inner shores of the Great South Bay, which is a spacious
lagoon separated from the Atlantic by a narrow beach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
or line of sand hills. This outer beach bears here and
there a ridge of pine forest or a lighthouse; but for the
rest, it is abandoned to sea-birds and grass, to the winds
and a few sand-flowers scattered among the wind markings
which are stencilled in purple upon the sand in
some delicate aerial deposit. Outside, even upon quiet
days, the surf beats ponderously with ominous sound,
the will and weight of the ocean in its swing. Within,
across the wide unruffled waters of the lagoon, populous
with sails, is the far-away fringe of the Babylon woods,
and over them, pale and blue, the hill-range above
Huntington.</p>

<p>The bay itself is a glorious mirror for the over-glow
of the sky at sunset or sunrise. Standing upon its inner
rim at Babylon, as the colour begins to die into the
dusk, you may see mysterious sails moving by hidden
waterways among fields still merry with the chirrup of
innumerable crickets; while beyond the rattle of cords
and pulleys and the liquid murmur of the moving boats,
beyond their lights that pierce the darkening water like
jewelled spears, glimmers a star on Fire Island beach to
greet the great liners as they pass by. In summer it is a
field of many harvests; famous for its blue-fish, its clams
and oysters; and neither the lads of Babylon nor their
young master were behind-hand in spearing eels, catching
crabs and gathering birds&rsquo; eggs.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In a hard winter
it is frozen over for months together.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For the greater part of the next four or five years,
Walt remained in the country, moving about from place
to place, and paying occasional visits to New York. He
is said to have been a good and popular teacher;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> and
if his equipment was not great, it was sufficient; he
liked boys and had the gift of imparting knowledge.
He took his work seriously, was always master in the
schoolroom, and knew whatever passed there. He
followed methods of his own; breaking loose from text-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>books,
to expound his knowledge and impart his own
interests to his scholars. The element of personality
told throughout his teaching; already it was notable as
the power behind all that he did. An impression of
himself, of his universal kindliness, of the sympathetic
quality of his whole person, his voice and look and
manner, and of a certain distinction and dignity inseparable
from him, was retained by his pupils in after
years.</p>

<p>His favourite method of punishment is worth recording,
as characteristic of his power and of his theory of
pedagogics. An admirable story-teller, he would chastise
any scholar who had behaved dishonourably, by
describing his conduct to the whole school, and without
the mention of a name, the guilty boy or girl was sufficiently
self-condemned and punished in his own shame.
Graver offences were made more public.</p>

<p>In recess and away from school, Walt was a sheer
boy, heartily joining in the most boisterous games and
sharing every kind of recreation consistent with his
kindly spirit. &ldquo;Gunning&rdquo; was never included.</p>

<p>Among the scholars there must often have been those
of his own years, and the fact that he could preserve
his status as a teacher while living on terms of frank
comradeship with his scholars, declares him born to
the office. They were mixed schools which he taught,
and towards the girls his attitude was one of honest
equanimity. He was the same with them as with the
boys, betraying neither a sentimental preference nor a
masculine disdain. Perhaps American girls with their
friendly ways and comparative lack of self-consciousness,
call for less fortitude on the young teacher&rsquo;s part than
some others; but Walt&rsquo;s own temperament stood him
in good stead. It seems improbable that he was ever
subject either to green-sickness or calf-love, and he was
no sentimentalist.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the idleness of which Mr. Spooner retained
so lively a recollection, might have hindered his becom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>ing
an ideal dominie. His thoughts must sometimes
have been far afield, his pupils and their tasks forgotten.
It was not, as I have already suggested, that he was
lazy; he worked hard and fast when his mind was
upon his work, and best of all perhaps as a teacher
in contact with human beings; but he was never so
busy that he could refuse to pursue an idea, never so
occupied that he could miss a new fact or emotion.</p>

<p>Like other young teachers, Walt probably learnt at
least as much as he taught, if not from his pupils, then
from their parents. Boarding with them, he came to
know and to love his own people, the peasant-yeomanry
of the island.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>He was a favourite with the friendly Long Island
youths and girls of his own years, but his closer friendships
seem to have been with older people: the well-balanced,
but strongly marked fathers and mothers of
families. He loved the country too, and all the occupations
and amusements of the open-air, into which he
had been initiated as a child. Thus he learned his
island by heart, wandering over it on foot, by day and
night; sailing its coasts and out into the waters beyond,
in pilot and fishing boats, to taste for himself the brave
sea life of those old salts, Williamses and Kossabones,
his mother&rsquo;s ancestors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the spring of 1838, we find him again at Huntington;
and here, in June,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> he founded a weekly journal,
the <i>Long Islander</i>, which is still published. Full of
interests, self-sufficient and ready with his pen, and in
close touch with his readers, he conducted the paper for
a while with success. He was nineteen and an enthusiast;
and he was both printer, editor and publisher.</p>

<p>Like others of the time, his paper was probably a
humble sheet of four small pages, and his task was not
so heavy as it may sound. He thoroughly enjoyed the
work, as well he might: the new responsibility and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
independence were admirably suited to his years and
temper. He purchased a press and type, and his printing
house was in the upper story of what is now a stable,
which stood on the main street of the town.</p>

<p>There he did most of the work himself, but I have
talked with an old man who shared his task at times.
And not his task only; for the printing room was, we
may be sure, the scene of much beside labour. Walt
loved companionship, and was an excellent story-teller;
he loved games, especially whist, which he would play&mdash;and
generally win&mdash;for a pumpkin pie. But when he
worked, he &ldquo;worked like the mischief,&rdquo; as the saying is;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and when he said so his companions knew that they
must go. They must have recognised, if they thought
about him at all in that way, that while he made no display
of his knowledge he knew far more than they, and
while he was an excellent comrade, it would not do to
treat Walt with too great familiarity.</p>

<p>As to his talk, it was clean and wholesome and self-respecting.
He was too much of a man already to
resort to the mannish tricks of many youths. He had,
moreover, at this time, a tinge of Puritanism, which did
him no harm: he neither smoked nor drank nor swore.
He contemned practical jokes. Maybe there was less
of Puritanism about him than of personal pride. He
was himself from the beginning, belonged to no set, and
went his own ways. He seemed to be everywhere and
to observe everything without obtruding himself anywhere.
And having purchased a horse, he carried the
papers round to the doors of his readers in the surrounding
townships. Often, afterwards, he recalled
those long romantic drives along the glimmering roads,
through the still fields and the dark oak woods under
the half-luminous starry sky, broken by friendly faces
and kind greetings.</p>

<p>But before the year was out the appearance of the
<i>Long Islander</i> became more and more irregular, till the
patience of its owner and subscribers was exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
In the spring it ceased for a time, and when it reappeared
it was numbered as a fresh venture under new
management.</p>

<p>Walt had gone back to school teaching at Babylon.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
He continued this work for two years more, wandering
from place to place, now at the Jamaica Academy, now
at Woodbury, now at Whitestone. He was, at this
time, a keen debater and politician, an Abolitionist, a
Washingtonian teetotaler, and ardently opposed to capital
punishment. He took an active share in the stump
oratory of 1840, when Van Buren of New York was for
the second time the Democratic nominee for President.
The fact, with the knowledge he always showed of the
art of oratory, and the plans for lecturing which he
afterwards drafted, seems to testify to a native capacity
for public speaking, as well as a genuine and serious
interest in the affairs of the nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Walt Whitman was becoming recognised as a young
man of ability: in spite of his nonchalant and friendly
unassuming ways, he had pride and ambition. He felt
in himself that he was capable of great things, and that
it was time to begin them. Not very clear as to what
his proper work might be, he took the turning of his
inclination, and early in the summer of 1841 entered
the office of the <i>New World</i>, as a compositor,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> to become
for the next twenty years one of the fraternity of New
York pressmen.</p>

<p>His first success was achieved in the August number
of the <i>Democratic Review</i>, one of the first American periodicals
of the day, which counted among its contributors
such writers as Bryant, Whittier, Hawthorne and Longfellow.
His &ldquo;Death in the Schoolroom,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> appearing
over the initials of &ldquo;W. W.,&rdquo; caught the public fancy,
and was widely copied by the provincial press. It is
the study of a gruesome incident in Long Island country
life; by turns sentimental and violent in its horror, and
evidently intended as an argument against school flog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>ging.
It has a sort of crude power and its subject
matter would have appealed to Hawthorne. It is by
no means discreditable; but to us it seems verbose, and
it is clumsy in its exaggerated style. Lugare is shown
to us at one moment standing as though transfixed by a
basilisk&mdash;and at another, &ldquo;every limb quivers like the
tongue of a snake&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Whatever its faults, they did not offend the taste of
the hour: the Review welcomed his contributions, and
some study from his pen appeared in its pages each
alternate month throughout the next year, some being
signed &ldquo;Walter Whitman&rdquo; in full. To the <i>New World</i>
he had meanwhile been contributing conventional and
very mediocre verses in praise of Death and of compassionate
Pity.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The remorse of a young murderer; an angel&rsquo;s compassionate
excuses for evil-doers; the headstrong revolt
of youth against parental injustice, and the ensuing
tragic fate; the half-insane repulsion of a father toward
his son, prompting him to send the lad to a madhouse
and thus wrecking his mind; the refusal of a young
poet to sell his genius; the pining of a lover after the
death of his beloved; the lonely misery of a deaf and
dumb girl, who has been seduced and deserted; the
reform of a profligate by a child; the sobering of a
drunkard at his little sister&rsquo;s death-bed; and an old
widow&rsquo;s strewing of flowers on every grave because her
husband&rsquo;s remains unknown: such are the subjects with
which he dealt.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> His wanderings in Long Island had
supplied him with incidents upon which to exercise his
imagination. Those which he selected have always some
pathetic interest, while several have an obviously didactic
purpose.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s moral consciousness was still predominant:
he was an advocate of &ldquo;causes&rdquo;. But his morality
sprang out of a real passion for humanity, which
took the form of sentiment; a sentiment which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
thoroughly genuine at bottom, but which in its expression
at this time, became false and stilted enough
to bear the reproach of sentimentality. In view of
their author&rsquo;s subsequent optimism, it is interesting to
note that all these studies are of figures or incidents,
more or less tragic.</p>

<p>Whitman was puzzling over the ultimate questions:
the problem of evil, as seen in the sufferings inflicted by
tyrannical power, and by callous or lustful selfishness,
upon innocent victims; on the inscrutable tragedies
of disease and insanity; and again, upon the power of
innocence, of sorrow and of love to evoke the good
which he saw everywhere latent in human nature, and
which a blind and heavy-handed legalitarian justice
would destroy with the evil inseparable from it. The
more he thought over these problems, the more he
recognised the futility of condemnation, and the effectiveness
of understanding love.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>New World</i>, upon which he was working, published
the first American versions of some of the principal
novels of the day; it reprinted several of the new poems
of Tennyson from English sources and contained long
notices of such works as Carlyle&rsquo;s <i>Heroes and Hero-worship</i>.
In November, 1842, it issued as an extra
number Dickens&rsquo;s <i>American Notes</i>, the sensation of the
hour&mdash;the author having been <i>fêted</i> at the Park Theatre
in February&mdash;and announced Lytton Bulwer&rsquo;s <i>Last of
the Barons</i> to follow. On the 23rd of the month, in the
same fashion, appeared <i>Franklin Evans, or The Inebriate</i>,
a tale of the times, by Walter Whitman. It was advertised
as a thrilling romance by &ldquo;one of the best novelists
in this country&rdquo;; and the proprietors of the magazine
expressed their hope that the well-told incidents of the
plot and the excellence of the moral would commend
the book to general circulation. Nor were they disappointed.
It is said that twenty thousand copies were
sold. The book, then, achieved a tolerable success, and
its author profited to the extent of some forty pounds.</p>

<p>Copies of <i>Franklin Evans</i> are now excessively rare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
and one may say with confidence they will remain so.
For the tale will never be reprinted. It claims to be
written for the people and not for the critics, and even
the people are unlikely to read it a second time.</p>

<p>It is an ill-told rambling story of a Long Island lad
who, going to the metropolis and taking to drink, falls
through various stages of respectability till he becomes
a bar-tender. He marries and reforms, but presently
gives way again to his habit; his wife then dies, and he
falls lower. Eventually he is rescued from gaol, and
signs the &ldquo;old&rdquo; pledge against ardent spirits. Then he
goes to Virginia, where he succeeds in fuddling his wits
with wine, and marries a handsome Creole slave. Forthwith
he becomes entangled with a white woman who
drives his wife to the verge of madness, until a tragic
fate releases him from them both, and the story concludes
with his signature to the pledge of total abstinence.
The author recommends it to his readers, and breaks out
into praises of the Washingtonian crusade, foretelling its
imminent and complete victory over the &ldquo;armies of
drink&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The pages are diversified by Indian and other narratives
impertinent to the plot, and by invectives against
the scornful attitude of the pious and respectable toward
those who are struggling in the nets of vice. The whole
book is loosely graphic and frankly didactic, its author
declaring his wish to be improving, though he will keep
the amusement of his readers in view. He opines that
in this temperance story he has found a novel and a
noble use for fiction, and if his first venture be successful,
be assured it will be followed by a second.</p>

<p>It is difficult to treat <i>Franklin Evans</i> seriously. That
Whitman was at the time a sincere advocate of the more
extreme doctrines of temperance reform can hardly
be doubted. But in after years&mdash;the whole incident
having become a matter of amusement to its author, not
wholly unmingled with irritation when, as sometimes, it
was thrust upon him anew by reformers as ardent as
he had once been&mdash;he would laugh and say with a
droll deliberation that the story was written against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
time one hot autumn in a Broadway beer-cellar, his
dull thoughts encouraged by bubbling libations. One
suspects a humorous malice in the anecdote, belonging
rather to his later than his earlier years. It may be
noted, however, that while Whitman commended the
pledge, he also commended a positive policy of &ldquo;counter
attraction&rdquo; to all the young men who scanned his pages,
to wit, an early marriage and a home, though he himself
remained a bachelor.</p>

<p><i>Franklin Evans</i> was honest enough. Young Whitman
was serving the adorable Lady Temperance with
fervour, if not with absolute consistency. He knew her
cause to be a good one; but he found that, in this form,
it was not quite his own, and he was too natural not to
be inconsistent. He had not yet come to his own cause,
nor for that matter to himself. And thus his essay
became a <i>tour de force</i>; as he did not repeat it, we may
suppose he was as little satisfied as those who now waste
an hour upon this &ldquo;thrilling romance&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He was now in the full stream of journalistic activity.
He wrote for the <i>New York Sun</i>, and appears for a few
months to have acted as editor in succession of the
<i>Aurora</i> and the <i>Tattler</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In 1843 he filled the same
post on the <i>Statesman</i>, and the year after upon the
<i>Democrat</i>; while contributing also to the <i>Columbian
Magazine</i>, the <i>American Review</i>, and Poe&rsquo;s <i>Broadway
Journal</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Probably none of these contributions are worthy of
recollection. Anomalous as it may sound, from twenty-three
to thirty-five Whitman was better fitted for an
editor than for an essayist. He was clever without
being brilliant; he had capacity but no special and definite
line of his own. His strength lay in his judgment;
and upon this both friends and family learnt to
rely.</p>

<p>Several of the papers for which he wrote were party
organs; it may have been that his political services in
1840 won him an introduction to the editors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
<i>Democratic Review</i>, and helped him on his further way.
In any case, it is certain that he frequented the party&rsquo;s
headquarters in the city. Tammany Hall was named
after an Indian brave,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> presumably to indicate the wholly
indigenous character of its interests. Towards the end
of the eighteenth century, it seems to have become the
seat of a society of old Knickerbockers, gathered partly
for mutual protection against certain groups of foreign
immigrants who had shown a hostile disposition, and
partly in opposition to the aristocratic Cincinnati Society
presided over by Washington. During Jefferson&rsquo;s Presidency
it became a political centre, and was identified
with the Democratic party from the time of its re-organisation
under Jackson in New York State.</p>

<p>The Democrats failed to elect Van Buren, and were
in opposition from 1840 to 1844. During the electoral
struggle, a Baltimore journal had spoken slightingly of
the humble character of Harrison, the Whig candidate:<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
better fitted, it pronounced, for a Western log-cabin
and a small pension than for the White House. Harrison,
like Andrew Jackson, was an old soldier: he had
beaten the Indians long ago in a fight at Tippecanoe;
and that, together with the simplicity of this Cincinnatus&mdash;the
imaginary log-cabin, the coon-skins and hard
cider, which made him the impersonation of the
frontiersman to whom America owed so much, being
all artfully exaggerated by party managers&mdash;caught the
fancy of the whole country, which rang for months together
with the refrain of &ldquo;Tippecanoe and Tyler too&rdquo;.
Harrison died immediately after his inauguration and
Vice-president Tyler took his place.</p>

<p>In Tammany&rsquo;s back parlour, Walt made the acquaintance
of many notables, and not least, of an old Colonel
Fellowes,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> who loved to discuss Tom Paine over a social
glass, and to scatter to the four winds the legends of
inebriety which had gathered about his later years of
poverty and neglect. But that Whitman was a violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
partisan even at this time, seems to be disproved by the
fact that in 1843 or 1844 he contributed political verses
to Horace Greeley&rsquo;s <i>Tribune</i>, a paper which had grown
out of the Whig election sheet.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> And though, like his
father, he adhered now and always to the general
political tradition of the Democrats, was a free trader,
jealous of the central power, and voted with his party
till it split in 1848, he was as good an Abolitionist as
Greeley himself. Indeed, both the <i>Tribune</i> poems are
inspired by the theme of slavery, and as if in witness to
the reality of their inspiration, he breaks for the first
time into the irregular metres he was to make his own.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>A religious ardour breathes from these singular Scriptural
utterances. The first, &ldquo;Blood-money,&rdquo; is a homily
on the text, &ldquo;Guilty of the body and the blood of Christ&rdquo;.
In the slave, whom he describes as &ldquo;hunted from the
arrogant equality of the rest,&rdquo; he sees the new incarnation
of that &ldquo;divine youth&rdquo; whose body Iscariot sold
and is still a-selling. It is an admirable piece of pathos,
fresh, direct and unmannered, and by far the most individual
and striking thing Whitman had done. And it
was the only one which could be regarded as prophetic
of the work that was to follow. Especially is this felt
in such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalked silently forward,</div>
<div class="verse">Since those ancient days; many a pouch enwrapping meanwhile</div>
<div class="verse">Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The piece was signed &ldquo;Paumanok,&rdquo; as also was &ldquo;A
Dough-face Song,&rdquo; which appeared in the <i>Evening Post</i>.</p>

<p>The second of the <i>Tribune</i> poems, &ldquo;Wounded in the
House of Friends,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> is inferior to the first in poetic
merit, though adopting a somewhat similar medium.
It is a rather violent denunciation of those intimates
of freedom whose allegiance to her can be bought
off&mdash;&ldquo;a dollar dearer to them than Christ&rsquo;s blessing&rdquo;&mdash;elderly
&ldquo;dough-faces&rdquo; whose hearts are in their
purses. It was upon Northern traitors to the cause
rather than upon the people of the South, that Whit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>man
poured out his indignation: and this position he
always maintained. The <i>Tribune</i> itself was at the time
an ardent supporter of Clay&rsquo;s candidature for the Presidency;
but Clay subsequently trimmed upon this very
question, and this action, by alienating the anti-slavery
party in New York, resulted in his defeat at the polls.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s political poems suggest already that
loosening of ties which separated him a few years later
from the main body of his party; but in 1844, following
the lead of advanced Democrats like W. C. Bryant,
he worked actively for Polk, the party candidate, who
became President.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> We cannot too often remind ourselves
that the later Republicanism of the &rsquo;sixties was
supported by men who had been Free-soil Democrats
as well as by certain of their Whig opponents. Meanwhile,
it was to the Radical wing of his party that
young Whitman belonged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though engaged in the political struggle, he was by
no means absorbed in it. His profession encouraged
his natural interest in the affairs of his country, but not
in the political affairs alone. He shared in the social
functions of the city and its district. He frequented
lectures and races, churches and auction rooms, weddings
and clam-bakes.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He spent Saturday afternoons
on the bare and then unfrequented sand ridge of Coney
Island, bathing, reading and declaiming aloud, uninterrupted
by a single one of the hundreds of thousands
who now fill the island with their more artificial holiday
making and their noisier laughter. In those days one
did not require a costume to bathe on Coney Island
beach.</p>

<p>Nearer than Coney Island, Brooklyn Ferry was always
one of his favourite haunts.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Walt had always loved
the boat as well as the river; as a child he had seen
the horses in the round-house give place to the engine
with its high &ldquo;smoke-stack&rdquo;; the captain and the
hands were old friends, and he never tired of watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
the passengers. Who does not feel the delight of such
a ferry, the swing of the boat, the windy gleam in the
sky, the lights by day or night upon the water, the
sense of weariless and unceasing movement as of life
itself? New York, on its island, is richer than most
cities in these river crossings, which take you at once
out of the closeness and cares of the streets into the free
broad roadways of wind and water, roadways which you
can scarcely traverse without some enlargement and
liberation of the city-pent soul in your breast.</p>

<p>And in the city itself he had a thousand interests;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
he went wherever people met together for any purpose;
he had a critic&rsquo;s free pass to the theatres and was often
at the opera and circus, he frequented the public libraries
too, and the collections of antiquities; but most of all he
loved to read in the open book of Broadway. Up and
down that amazing torrent of humanity he would ride,
breasting its flood, upon the box-seat of one of the
stages, beside the driver. From time to time he would
make himself useful by giving change to the fares
within, when he was not already too fully occupied
declaiming the great passages from his favourite poets
into the ears of his friend.</p>

<p>The fulness of human life surging through the artery
of that great city exhilarated him like the west wind or
the sound and presence of the sea. The sheer contact
with the crowd excited him. And though he came to
know New York in all its dark and sordid corners&mdash;and
even an American city before the war was not without
its shame&mdash;he won an inspiration from its multitudinous
humanity distinct from any that the country-side could
afford. Every year he grew more conscious of his
membership in the living whole of human life; and the
consciousness which brought despair to Carlyle, brought
faith and glory to Whitman. He did not blink the ugly
and sinister aspects of things, as many an optimist has
done; he saw clearly the brothel, the prison, and the
mortuary; his writing at this time, as we have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
deals largely with the tragedies of life; but humanity
fascinated him&mdash;not an abstract or ideal humanity, but
the concrete actual humanity of New York. For its
own sake he loved it, body and soul, as a man should.
It was not philanthropy, it was the wholesome, native
love of a man for his own flesh and blood, for the incarnation
of the Other in the same substance as the Self.</p>

<p>Very little passed in the city without his knowledge.
He was in the crowd that welcomed Dickens in 1842;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
and was doubtless among the thousands who celebrated
the introduction of the first water from the Croton
supply into New York, and hailed the pioneer locomotive
arriving over the new track from Buffalo. Among the
public figures of the day, he became familiar with the
faces of great politicians like Webster and Clay; among
writers, he saw Fitz-Green Halleck and Fenimore
Cooper,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and made the acquaintance of Poe who was
struggling against poverty in New York, and who became
at this time&mdash;1845&mdash;suddenly famous through the
publication of &ldquo;The Raven&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and won the more lasting
friendship of Bryant, who was at that time the preeminent
American poet, and held besides the editorship
of the <i>Evening Post</i>, to which Walt had been a contributor.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In February, 1846, Whitman was appointed editor of
the <i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> a democratic journal of a
single sheet. The office was close to the Ferry, and he
seems at this time to have lived with his family on
Myrtle Avenue, near Fort Greene, rather more than a
mile away. His editorials boasted no literary distinction,
and were even at times of doubtful grammar; but they
were direct and vigorous, and discussed all the topics of
the hour.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> When a New York Episcopal Church was
consecrated with much ceremony and display, he would
denounce the self-complacent attitude of the Churches;
every instance of lynching or of capital punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
would call forth his protest; he was faithful in his
support of the rights of domestic animals; he approved
of dancing within reasonable hours, and he advocated
art in the homes of the people. Largely owing to his
persistent advocacy the old battle-ground of Fort Greene
was secured to Brooklyn as a park.</p>

<p>In dealing with the immediately critical question of
relations with Mexico, while he anticipated extension of
territory without dismay, he uttered his warning against
the temper which prompts a nation to aggressive acts.
&ldquo;We fear&rdquo;, he said,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> &ldquo;our unmatched strength may
make us insolent. We fear that we shall be too willing
(holding the game in our own hands) to revenge our
injuries by war&mdash;the greatest curse that can befall a
people, and the bitterest obstacle to the progress of all
those high and true reforms that make the glory of this
age above the darkness of the ages past and gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The admission of Texas into the Union, in 1845, was
soon followed by a war with Mexico, which eventually
completed the filibustering work of Houston by the
annexation of New Mexico and California. This
territorial expansion was pushed forward, as we noted
before, by Polk and the Democrats in the interests of
the South;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but the fact that it was Wilmot, a Free-soil
Democrat, who introduced the celebrated proviso
to an appropriation of money for the war, proposing to
exclude slavery from all territory which might be acquired
from Mexico, reminds us of the division within
the party which resulted in a split two years later.</p>

<p>The country at this time was in a condition of feverish
irritation; and the war spirit was only too easily
aroused. In 1847, it threatened to burst into flame
over a territorial dispute with Great Britain. America
claimed the latitude of 54.40 as the northern boundary
of Oregon, and for awhile, under the jingo President,
the country rang with the insane alliterative cry of
&ldquo;fifty-four forty or fight&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> A spirited foreign policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
is the universal panacea of the charlatan; it is his
receipt for every internal disorder, and it was continually
being prescribed to America during the next fifteen
years. This was indeed the charlatan&rsquo;s hour, when
the official policy of the dominant Democratic party
oscillated between jingoism and what was afterwards
known throughout America as &ldquo;squatter sovereignty&rdquo;.
It was the repudiation of the Wilmot proviso, and the
adoption of the new doctrine which Douglas afterwards
made his own, that drove Whitman into revolt.</p>

<p>He was comfortably seated in his editorial chair,
where he might have remained for years had his Radical
convictions permitted. Though the owners of the <i>Eagle</i>
were orthodox party men, the editor&rsquo;s anti-slavery
attitude was not concealed,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and indeed could not be.
Their criticism of his editorials caused him immediately
to throw up his post. He would not compromise on
the question, and he would not brook interference. It
was January, 1848, when he left the <i>Eagle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and a few
weeks later he was making his way south to New
Orleans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman had joined the &ldquo;Barnburners&rdquo; or Van
Buren men of New York State, who now became Free-soil
Democrats, making the Wilmot proviso their platform,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
in opposition to the &ldquo;Hunkers,&rdquo; who denounced
it. As to the Whigs, they burked the whole matter,
and contrived in their nominating convention to silence
the question by shouting. The Democratic party
found its real platform in the nostrum of &ldquo;squatter
sovereignty,&rdquo; the specious doctrine that in each new
State the citizens should themselves decide upon their
attitude towards slavery, deciding for or against it when
drawing up a Constitution. To this, Lewis Cass, its
candidate for the Presidency, subscribed. But the
&ldquo;Barnburners&rdquo; put forward Van Buren, a former
President, and a Democrat of the school of Jefferson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
and Jackson, who was also supported by the &ldquo;anti-slavery&rdquo;
party. His policy was to confine slavery
within its actual limits: &ldquo;no more Slave states, no
more slave territory&rdquo;. As a consequence of the Democratic
split in the Empire State, the thirty-six electoral
votes of New York were given to the Whig candidate,
General Taylor, the Mexican conqueror, and he became
the next President.</p>

<p>A whole-hearted Free-soil Democrat, Whitman&rsquo;s
position as editor of an orthodox party journal had
naturally become untenable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">ROMANCE (1848)</p>


<p class="p2">Whitman was nearly twenty-nine, and had not,
so far as I can discover, wandered beyond the
limits of his own State,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> nor had he experienced, to our
knowledge, any serious affair of the heart. The only
trace of strong personal emotion in his writing hitherto
is that which we found in the <i>Tribune</i> poems, dictated
by the passion of human solidarity. &ldquo;Blood Money&rdquo; is
probably the only thing which he had yet produced
from the deeper regions of consciousness; it is the only
piece of real self-revelation which he had yet confided
to the world. Now we come suddenly upon a time of
wandering, over which he himself has drawn a veil&mdash;a
veil which covers, we cannot for a moment doubt, one
of the most important incidents of his life. But it is a
veil which we are unable to raise.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Walking in the lobby of the old Broadway Theatre,
between the acts, one February night,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Whitman was
introduced to a Southern gentleman. A quarter of an
hour later he had engaged to go South, to assist in
starting the <i>Crescent</i>, a daily paper in New Orleans.
On the eleventh of the month he set out.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The South
was as unknown to him as it still remains to the
majority of Northerners; and the South must have been
as strange and fascinating to the son of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Mannhatta">Mannahatta</span> as
are the shores of the Mediterranean to a Londoner. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
air of romance seems to breathe from his every reference
to this period, and it may well be that the passionate
attraction which afterwards drew his memory to the
&ldquo;magnet-south&rdquo; had some personal incarnation.</p>

<p>Bidding a hasty good-bye to his family and friends,
he left New York and made his way<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> through populous
Pennsylvania, and over the Alleghanies to Wheeling on
the Ohio river, where he found a small steamer, and in
it descended leisurely, with many stops by the way,
through the recently settled lands of Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky, and Illinois, into the Mississippi, the Father
of Waters, thenceforward pursuing his voyage for more
than a thousand miles along that greatest of American
highways, to the borders of the Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p>For the first time his eyes saw how vast was his
country: he realised the South, and he understood the
significance of the political struggle for the control of
the new West. He was almost afraid as he journeyed,
not so much at the immensity of the prospect, as because
he felt himself upon the verge of the Unknown
and its mysteries: and his feelings found utterance in
some verses written on the voyage and subsequently
published&mdash;surely, with a smile at the critics&mdash;in his
<i>Collected Prose</i>. As they illustrate his mood at the time,
and afford the best example of his skill as a maker of
conventional verses, I may quote from them here.</p>

<p>After describing the fantastic forms which line the
margins of the forest-bordered river, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Tide of youth, thus thickly planted,</div>
<div class="verse2">While in the eddies onward you swim,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus on the shore stands a phantom army,</div>
<div class="verse2">Lining for ever the channel&rsquo;s rim.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Steady, helmsman! you guide the immortal;</div>
<div class="verse2">Many a wreck is beneath you piled,</div>
<div class="verse">Many a brave yet unwary sailor</div>
<div class="verse2">Over these waters has been beguiled.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Nor is it the storm or the scowling midnight,</div>
<div class="verse2">Gold, or sickness, or fire&rsquo;s dismay&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor is it the reef or treacherous quicksand</div>
<div class="verse2">Will peril you most on your twisted way.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But when there comes a voluptuous languor,</div>
<div class="verse2">Soft the sunshine, silent the air,</div>
<div class="verse">Bewitching your craft with safety and sweetness,</div>
<div class="verse2">Then, young pilot of life, beware.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lines are not of the best, but they are suggestive.
They seem to express the lurking fear of one hardily
bred in the North, when first he feels upon his face the
breath of the seductive South. His strenuous self-sufficiency
is imperilled. A strange world of sensations
surrounds him, awakening in himself a world of emotions
as strange. It is suggested to him that he is not
quite the man that he supposed, that there is another
side to his character, and he resents the suggestion.
For who will willingly begin over again the task of self-discovery?
The conservative organising active Ego
fears the awakening of the adventurous, receptive Ego.
I think Whitman was startled as he realised how little
as yet he understood himself, or was willing to accept
his whole soul if it should rise up and face him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i048.jpg" width="800" height="513" alt="Picture of New Orleans about the time of Walt's visit." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">NEW ORLEANS ABOUT THE TIME OF WHITMAN&rsquo;S VISIT, FROM A PRINT</p></div>
</div>

<p>The New Orleans of &rsquo;48 must have been the most
romantic and perhaps the most prosperous city in the
Union. It was the centre of Western commerce, as
well as of Mexican filibustering: its great hotels, the
St. Charles and the St. Louis, were the rendezvous of
planters and merchants, politicians and adventurers,
and of the proudest aristocracy in the States.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> It was
a gay city, with its Creole women and Spanish men, its
dancing and its play, its masks and dominoes, its duels
and carnivals; gay as only an old city can be gay, with
the contrast between age and youth.</p>

<p>About the Catholic cathedral was a mass of irregular
red-tiled roofs and a net-work of shady alleys, on to
which opened great galleries and courtyards full of
vines. Scent of roses and the caressing sound of Creole
singing stole upon the languorous breaths of the warm
humid air, breaths which lazily stirred the golden-rod
that overgrew the dormer windows, the old venetian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
blinds, the geraniums and the clothes hanging in the
sun. Along the alleys went the priests in their black
skirts. Through the doorways one saw red floors sanded
and clean, and quaint carved furniture, heirlooms of
generations; or caught a glimpse of some old garden
with its fountains and lilies, its violets and jonquils,
myrtle and jessamine. Everywhere flowers and singing
birds, and the soft quaint Creole phrases falling with the
charm that only Southern lips confer.</p>

<p>Such was the old French quarter. Along the river-side
was another; the lawless world of Mississippi flat-boatmen,
a vagrant population drawn from many States,
who with the soldiers discharged after the Mexican war
frequented the low saloons and gaming-houses; passionate
men, capable of any crime or adventure.</p>

<p>Again, there were the Bohemians of the city, the
artists, journalists and actors of a centre of fashion.
Opera had found its first American home at New Orleans,
and was presented at the famous Orleans Theatre
four times a week. Whitman, the opera-goer, must
often have been there. Perhaps he met among the
Bohemians a juvenile member of their group, Dolores
Adios Fuertes, a young dancer, to be known hereafter
in London and in Paris as Adah Isaacs Menken, actress,
and authoress of a pathetic volume of irregular metres,
who now lies buried at Mont Parnasse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the three months of his stay, Whitman saw
New Orleans thoroughly.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Often on Sunday mornings
he would go to the cathedral; he idled much in the old
French quarters, and sauntered and loafed along the
levees, making acquaintances and friends among the
boatmen and stevedores. He frequented the huge bar-rooms
of the two hotels, where most of the business of
the city seems at that time to have been transacted;
but temperate and simple himself, he preferred to their
liqueurs and dainties his morning coffee and biscuit at
the stall of a stout mulatto woman, who stood with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
shining copper kettle in the French market. There all
the races of the world seemed to be gathered to idle or
to bargain. He went also to the theatres, where he
talked with the soldiers back from the Mexican war;
among the rest, with General Taylor, soon to be President,
a jovial, genial, laughter-loving old man, one of the
plainest who ever went to the White House, where he
died soon after his inauguration in 1849.</p>

<p>Whitman appears to have been thoroughly enjoying
himself, when suddenly about the end of May, he made
up his mind to return to the North. His brother Jeff,
a lad of fifteen, who had accompanied him and was
working in the printing office, was homesick and out of
health; the climate with its malarial tendencies did
not suit him. Walt was always devoted to this young
brother, who had been his companion on many a Long
Island holiday, tramping or sailing,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and becoming
alarmed at his condition, hurried him away. There
were other reasons which, he says, made him wish to
leave the city, but as he does not specify<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> them himself,
we can only follow the indications in guessing at
their nature. We know they were not connected with
his work: it is probable that they were private and
personal.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When asked in later years why he had never married,
he would say either that it was impossible to give a
satisfactory explanation,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> although such an explanation
might perhaps exist, or he would declare that, with an
instinct for self-preservation, he had always avoided or
escaped from entanglements which threatened his freedom.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
These replies he made with an obvious reticence
and reservation. He who professed to make so clean a
breast of his own shortcomings, and who in his last
years required that records of himself should err in
being somewhat over personal, deliberately concealed
certain important incidents in his life. There can, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
think, be only one interpretation of this singular state
of affairs: that these incidents concerned others equally
with himself, and that those others were unwilling to
have them published. If they had been his, and his
alone, he would have communicated them, but they
were not.</p>

<p>Whatever Whitman&rsquo;s duty in this matter, it behoves
his biographer to present as full a picture as possible of
his life, and to let no fact go by without notice; while
the knowledge that Whitman himself could not disclose
the whole truth, should only make us the more careful
in our reading of the scanty facts which are known.</p>

<p>It seems that about this time Walt formed an intimate
relationship with some woman of higher social
rank than his own&mdash;a lady of the South where social
rank is of the first consideration&mdash;that she became the
mother of his child, perhaps, in after years, of his
children; and that he was prevented by some obstacle,
presumably of family prejudice, from marriage or the
acknowledgment of his paternity.</p>

<p>The main facts can now hardly be disputed. Whitman
put some of them on record in a letter to Addington
Symonds during the last year of his life, designing to
leave a fuller statement in the care of his executors.
But this, through access of weakness, was never accomplished.
Remarks which he let fall from time to
time in private conversation seem to admit of no other
interpretation than that I have put upon them.</p>

<p>In one of his poems<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> he vividly describes how once in a populous city
he chanced to meet with a woman who cast her love upon him, and how
they remained together till at last he tore himself away, to remember
nothing of that city save her and her love. In spite of Whitman&rsquo;s
express desire that the poem should be regarded merely in its universal
application&mdash;a desire which in itself seems to betoken a consciousness
of self-betrayal&mdash;we cannot but recognise its autobiographical
suggestion. And in the stress laid upon the part of the woman, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span> may
see a cause for Whitman&rsquo;s reticence. If it was she who had pressed the
relationship, it behoved him the more, for her sake, to keep silence,
and to leave the determination of the relationship to her.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important evidence upon this
obscure passage of his story is to be found in the psychological
development which we can, as I believe, trace
in his character. It was but a short time after his
Southern visit,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> perhaps in the same year, that he began
to sketch out some of the poems which afterwards took
the form familiar to us in <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. Now these
differ from his earlier writings in many ways, but fundamentally
in their subjectivity. In them he sets out to
put himself on record in a way he heretofore had not
attempted, and this enterprise must, I take it, have had
its cause in some quickening of emotional self-consciousness.
That process may well have culminated a few
years later in what has been described as &ldquo;cosmic
consciousness&rdquo;; but before that culmination, Whitman&rsquo;s
experience must have contained elements which
do not seem to have been present in the Whitman of
<i>Franklin Evans</i>, or of the verses written upon the Mississippi.
These elements, I believe, he acquired or began
to acquire in the South.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have seen him as a young man of
vigorous independence, eagerly observant of life, and
delighting in his contact with it. Henceforward he
enters into it in a new sense; some barrier has been
broken down; he begins to identify himself with it.
Strong before in his self-control, he is stronger still now
that he has won the power of self-abandonment. Unconsciously
he had always been holding himself back;
at last he has let himself go. And to let oneself go is
to discover oneself. Some men can never face that
discovery; they are not ready for emancipation. Whitman
was.</p>

<p>But who emancipated him? May we not suppose it
was a passionate and noble woman who opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
gates for him and showed him himself in the divine
mirror of her love? Had Whitman been an egoist such
a vision would have enslaved and not liberated his soul.</p>

<p>But if this woman loved him to the uttermost, why
did he leave her? Why did he allow the foulest of
reproaches to blacken that whitest of all reputations, a
Southern lady&rsquo;s virtue? Nowhere in the world could
such a reproach have seemed more vile, more cruel.
The only answer we can make is that it was, in some
almost inexplicable way, her choice. And that somehow,
perhaps by a fictitious marriage, this reproach was doubtless
avoided; the woman&rsquo;s family being readier to invent
some subterfuge than to take a Northern journalist and
artisan into their sacred circle. There is a poem which
remained till recently in manuscript&mdash;a poem<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of bitter
sarcasm and marked power of expression&mdash;in which
Whitman holds an aristocrat up to scorn. He never
printed it himself, and this fact adds to the possibility
that it may gain some of its force from personal suffering.</p>

<p>Whether Whitman met his lady again we do not
know. There is no record of a second visit to the South,
though there is no evidence to disprove such a visit; rather
indeed, to the contrary, for Whitman speaks in one of
his letters<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of &ldquo;times South&rdquo; as periods in which his
life lay open to criticism; and refers, elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> to his
having lived a good deal in the Southern States. As he
was in no position to reply to criticism upon this matter,
he was careful not to arouse it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatever lay behind his departure, Whitman left
New Orleans on the 25th of May, 1848,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> ascending the
Mississippi in a river steamer between the monotonous
flat banks. Jeff picked up at once.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> They spent a few
hours in St. Louis where the westward flowing streams
of northern and of southern pioneers met and mingled.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Changing boats, and passing the mouth of the great yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
Missouri, they made their way up the Illinois river for
some two hundred miles, arriving after forty-eight hours
at La Salle, whence a canal boat carried them to Chicago.
Through the rich agricultural lands of Illinois they
passed at a speed not exceeding three miles an hour.</p>

<p>They spent a day in the still very young metropolis of
the North-west, travelling thence by way of the Great
Lakes to Buffalo. The voyage occupied five glorious
summer days. Whitman went on shore at every stopping
place intensely interested in everything. He was
so delighted with the State of Wisconsin, which was
about this time admitted to the Union, that he dreamed
of settling in one of its new clean townships; and he
carried away with him definite impressions of the towns
of Milwaukee, Mackinaw, Detroit, Windsor, Cleveland,
and Buffalo.</p>

<p>A week from La Salle he passed under the Falls of
Niagara and saw the whirlpool; but coming at the end
of so much wonder, the stupendous spectacle does not
seem to have greatly impressed him. Twenty-four hours
of continuous travel through the thickly settled country
districts of New York State brought him to the old
Dutch capital of Albany, whence descending the beautiful
Hudson with its wooded high-walled mountain banks,
he reached New York on the evening of 15th June.</p>

<p>He had been away from home four months, had
travelled as many thousand miles, and had made acquaintance
with seventeen of the States of the Union.
In New Orleans he had learnt the meaning of the South,
from St. Louis he had looked into the new West, while
in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, and the coasts
of Ontario, he had seen the rich corn-lands of the North-west
under their first tillage. And he had felt the
meaning of the Mississippi, that great river whose
tributaries, from the Alleghanies to the Rockies, drain
and fertilise half the arable land of America.</p>

<p>Besides the discovery in himself of a new world, a
new hemisphere, Whitman came home filled with the
sense of his American citizenship. A patriot from his
childhood, from henceforward &ldquo;these States,&rdquo; as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
loved to call them, became the object of his passionate
devotion. Not in their individuality alone&mdash;though this
he recognised more than ever, regarding each in some
degree as a nation&mdash;but above all in their Union. Thus
he came back to Brooklyn to take up his old vocation and
his old acquaintances with a sense of enlargement: latent
powers had been awakened within him and a new ideal
which may once have been a childish dream, began to
dominate his manhood, hitherto lacking in a clear purpose.</p>

<p>In the old days,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> when his mother read the Bible to
him and taught him something of its meaning, it had
seemed to the child that the highest of all the achievements
of manhood must be to make such another book
as that. It had been written thousands of years ago by
inspired men, to be completed some day by others as
truly inspired as they. For he believed in the Quaker
doctrine of the continuity of revelation, which is not
strange to a child.</p>

<p>Such fancies in a child&rsquo;s mind are apt to grow into a
purpose: to dream, is to dream of something one will
presently do. If the dream is wholly beyond the range
of possible accomplishment, a cloud of disillusionment descending
on the face of youth will blot it out; but if it is
not, it may become an ideal which will shape the whole
of manhood as sternly as any fate.</p>

<p>To be an American prophet-poet, to make the American
people a book which should be like the Bible in
spiritual appeal and moral fervour, but a book of the
New World and of the new spirit&mdash;such seems to have
been the first and the last of Whitman&rsquo;s day-dreams.
It must have come to him as a vague longing when
he was still very young, and he was never so old as to
lose it. Now on his return from this long journey, his
mind full of America and full of profound and mystical
thoughts concerning love and the soul and the soul&rsquo;s
relation to the world, the dream began to struggle in
him for utterance. It was seven years before it found
itself a body of words, but henceforward it took possession
of his life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">ILLUMINATION</p>


<p class="p2">Whitman returned to Brooklyn about the time
that Free-soil Democrats and Liberty men
were uniting at Buffalo on the ticket and platform which
I have already described. He established a small book-store
and printing office on Myrtle Avenue,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and commenced
the publication of the <i>Freeman</i>, a weekly first,
but afterwards a daily paper.</p>

<p>The venture continued for about a year but eventually
proved unsuccessful. Its failure may have been due to
the comparatively small circle of readers which the
Free-soil party in Brooklyn could provide, or it may
have resulted from the same lack of regularity which
killed the <i>Long Islander</i>. It is not improbable that
Whitman wearied of the continuous mechanical production
demanded by the ownership and management
of a daily paper. He was not methodical; and his mind
was struggling with ideas which made him restless in
harness, ideas so large and fundamental that much of
the merely ephemeral detail of journalism must have
become irritating and irksome. When the <i>Freeman</i>
collapsed it was a bondage broken, and its owner and
editor became a freeman himself.</p>

<p>His father was some sixty years of age and failing
in health, and for lack of anything more suited to his
state of mind, Walt joined him, taking up his business
and becoming a master carpenter, building small frame-houses
in Brooklyn and selling them upon completion
as his father had been doing these thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Brooklyn was growing fast, and the Whitmans
prospered. Walt lived at home and spent little; he was
soon on the way to become rich. What was more
important, he was now the master of his own time; and
carpentering left his mind free to work entirely in its
own way. He was no longer being &ldquo;pushed for copy&rdquo;.
When the mood was urgent he could idle; that is to say,
he could give himself up to his thoughts. He could
dream, but the saw in his hand and the crisp timber
kept him close to reality. He was out of doors, too,
and among things rather than thoughts, so that his
ideas were but rarely bookish.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet though he was the opposite of bookish he was
not ill-read. He always carried a volume or part of a
magazine in his knapsack with his mid-day dinner;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
and every week for years he had visited Coney Island
beach to bathe there and to read. He watched the
English and American reviews, bought second-hand
copies whenever they contained matter of interest to
him, tore out his prize and devoured it with his sandwich.
He loved especially to read a book in its native
elements: the <i>Inferno</i><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> in an ancient wood, Homer in a
hollow of the rocks with the Atlantic surf on either
hand, while he saw all the stage-plays of Shakespeare
upon the boards.</p>

<p>He had always remained faithful to Scott, and especially
to the Border ballads of his collection, with their
innumerable and repaying notes. He studied the Bible
systematically and deliberately, weighing it well and
measuring it by the standards of outdoor America in the
nineteenth century. In the same way and spirit he had
read and re-read Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays before seeing them,
until he could recite extended passages; and he had
come to very definite conclusions about their feudal
and aristocratic atmosphere and influence.</p>

<p>He read Æschylus and Sophocles in translations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
felt himself nearer to the Greeks than to Shakespeare
or the Middle Ages. It is interesting to note that he
barely mentions Euripides, most modern of the Hellenes,
the poet of women, and was evidently little acquainted
with Plato. Surely if he had read <i>The Republic</i> or <i>The
Symposium</i> there could be no uncertainty upon the
matter.</p>

<p>But about another poet, as opposed to Plato as any in
the category, there is no shade of doubt. Whitman,
like Goethe and Napoleon, was a lover of that shadowy
being whom Macpherson exploited with such success&mdash;Ossian
the Celt.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Ossian is dead, and for good reasons&mdash;we
can do much better than read Ossian to-day; but
with all his mouthings and in spite of the pother of his
smoke, he is not without a flavour of those Irish epics
which are among the perfect things of pure imagination.
And when one thinks of the eighteenth century with
its town wit, one cannot wonder at the welcome Macpherson&rsquo;s
Ossian won. Great billowy sea-mists engulf
its reader; and through them he perceives phantom-forms,
which, though they are but the shadows of men,
are pointed out to him for gods. But at least the sea is
there, and the wind and an outdoor world. Whitman
was not blind to the indefinite and misty in Ossian.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
He himself clung to the concrete, and though he could
rant he preferred upon the whole to use familiar phrases.
But he loved Ossian for better, for worse. And we may
add as a corollary he disliked Milton.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In the case of the foreign classics I have mentioned,
and of others like Don Quixote, Rousseau, and the
stories of the Nibelungen,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> he fell back upon translations,
and in works of classical verse, often upon prose. He
declaimed the <i>Iliad</i> in Pope&rsquo;s heroics, but he studied it
according to Buckley.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>As a journalist and writer for the magazines, he had
become more or less acquainted with contemporary
literature, but, with few exceptions only, it seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
affected him negatively. He knew something of Wordsworth,
Byron and Keats;<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the first he said was too
much of a recluse and too little of a lover of his kind;
Byron was a pessimist, and in the last of the three he
seemed only to find one of the over-sensitive products of
civilisation and gentility. Tennyson&mdash;whose &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo;
(1842) was a special favourite&mdash;interested him from the
beginning, though Whitman always resented what he
called his &ldquo;feudal&rdquo; atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> It is doubtful whether
he had yet read anything of Carlyle&rsquo;s, though he would
be acquainted with the ideas of <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship</i>.</p>

<p>Among Americans, he was apparently most familiar
with Bryant and with Fenimore Cooper. When he
first studied Emerson is uncertain; he seems to have
known him as a lecturer, and could not have been
ignorant of the general tendencies of his teaching.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Longfellow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Evangeline,&rdquo; Lowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Biglow Papers&rdquo; and
Whittier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voices of Freedom&rdquo; were the talk of the time.
He had met Poe; and his tragic death at Baltimore in
1849 may have set him to re-read the brilliant but disappointing
verses, and profounder criticism, of that ill-starred
genius.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>But it was from the pages of the Bible, of Homer and
of Shakespeare, of Ossian and of Scott that he derived
most. Ballads he loved when they came from the folk;
but Blake and Shelley, the purely lyrical writers of the
new era, do not seem to have touched him; perhaps
they were hardly virile enough, for when he came to
know and appreciate Burns, it was as a lyrist who was
at once the poet of the people and a full-blooded man.
From all of which it may be deduced that it was the
elemental and the virile, rather than the subtle qualities
of imagination which appealed to him; he responded
to breadth and strength of movement and of passion,
rather than to any kind of formal or static beauty. For
him, poetry was a passionate movement, the rhythm
of progress, the march of humanity, the procession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
Freedom. It was more; it was an abandonment to
world-emotions. Where he felt this abandonment to
inspiration, he recognised poetry, and only there. In
American literature he did not feel it at all.</p>

<p>When he read poetry, the sea was his favourite companion.
The rhythm of the waves satisfied the rhythmical
needs of his mind. Everything that belonged to
the sea exercised a spell over him. The first vision that
made him desire the gift of words was that of a full-rigged
ship;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and the love of ships and shipping remained
a passion with him to the end; so that when he
sought to describe his own very soul it was as a ship
he figured it. For the embrace of the sea itself, for the
swimmer&rsquo;s joy,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> he had the lover&rsquo;s passion of a Swinburne
or a Meredith.</p>

<p>His reading was not, of course, confined to pure literature,
but we have no list of the books which he read in
other departments. We know that he was deeply interested
in the problems of philosophy and the discoveries
of science.</p>

<p>Though never what is called a serious student of their
works, he had a good understanding of the attitude
both of the metaphysicians and of the physicists of his
time; and he had no quarrel with either. In his simple
and direct way he came indeed very near to them both;
for he loved and reverenced concrete fact as he reverenced
the concept of the cosmos. Individual facts were
significant to him because they were all details of a
Whole, but he loved facts too for their own sake. And
to the Whole, the cosmos, his soul responded as ardently
as to the detailed parts. The deeper his knowledge of
detail&mdash;the closer his grasp upon facts&mdash;the more intense
must be his consciousness of the Whole. This
consciousness of the Whole illuminated him more fully
about this date, in a way I will soon recount; it must
for some time previously have been exercising an influence
upon his thought.</p>

<p>Regarding poetry as the rhythmical utterance of emo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>tions
which are produced in the soul by its relation to
the world, he doubtless regarded science as the means
by which that world becomes concrete, diverse and real
to the soul, as it becomes one and comprehensible to
it through philosophy. Science and philosophy seemed
alike essential, not hostile, to poetry. Poetry is the
utterance of an inspired emotion; but an emotion inspired
by what? By the discovery that the Other and
the Self are so akin that joy and passion arise from
their contact.</p>

<p>In order to conceive of science or philosophy as hostile
to poetry, we must think of them as building up
some barrier between us and the world. But in this
respect modern science does not threaten poetry, for it
recognises the homogeneity of a material self with a material
world; neither does idealism threaten the source
of this emotion, regarding the self and the world as
both essentially ideal.</p>

<p>The aim of modern thought has been, not to isolate
the soul, but rather to give it back to the world of relations.
It seems to me that, in so far as Religion has
attempted to separate between the Self and things, between
God and Man, between the soul and the flesh,
Religion has cut at the roots of poetry; but the Religion
which attempted this is not, I believe, the religion of
the modern world.</p>

<p>Whitman then accepted modern science and philosophy
with equanimity, in so far as he understood
them, and in their own spheres. Apparent antagonisms
between them did not trouble him. They were for him
different functions of the one soul. He was too sensible
of his own identity and unity in himself to share in the
perplexity of those who lose this sense through the
exclusive exercise of one or other of their functions.
His joint exercise of these proved them to be harmonious.
He was unconscious of any quarrel in himself between
the scientific and the poetic, the religious and the philosophic
faculties.</p>

<p>Definitions in such large matters must generally seem
absurd and almost useless, yet here they may be sug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>gestive.
If Whitman had formulated his thought he
might, perhaps, have said: &ldquo;Science is the Self probing
into the details of the Not-self; Philosophy is the
Self describing the Not-self as a Whole; Religion is the
attitude of the Self toward the Not-self; and Poetry
springs from the passionate realisation of the homogeneity
of the Self with the Not-self&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In such rough and confessedly crude definitions we
may suggest, at <span class="correction" title="In the original book: anyrate">any rate</span>, a theory for his attitude toward
the thought of his day. That thought, it seems unnecessary
to add, was impregnated by the positive spirit
of science. Names like those of Leibnitz, Lamarck,
Goethe, Hegel and Comte remind us that the idea
of evolution was becoming more and more suggestive
in every field&mdash;soon to be enforced anew, and more
definitely, by Darwin, Wallace and Spencer. The idea
of an indwelling and unfolding principle or energy is
the special characteristic of nineteenth century thought;
and it has been accompanied by a new reverence for all
that participates in the process of becoming. Every
form of life has its secret, and is worthy of study, for
that secret is a part of the World&rsquo;s Secret, the Eternal
Purpose which affects every soul. We are each a part
of that progressive purpose which we call the universe.
But we are each absolutely and utterly distinct and individual.
Every one has his own secret, his own purpose;
in the old phrase, it is to his own master that
each one standeth or falleth.</p>

<p>Ideas such as these, the affirmations of a new age,
were driving the remnants of the old faiths and the
dogmas of the school of Paley into the limbo of the
incredible; but they were also casting out the futile
atheisms and scepticisms of the dead century. The era
of Mazzini, Browning, Ruskin, Emerson, was an era of
affirmations, not an era of doubt. And Whitman caught
the spirit of his age: eagerly he accepted and assimilated
it.</p>

<p>His knowledge of modern thought came to him
chiefly through the more popular channels of periodical
literature, and through conversations with thoughtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
men. Probably the largest and most important part of
his reading, then and always, was the daily press. A
journalist himself, he had besides an insatiable craving
for living facts, and especially for American facts. He
wanted to know everything about his country. America
was his passion: he understood America. Sometimes
he wondered if he was alone in that.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The papers were, indeed, crowded with news of enterprise
and adventure. In California, the new territory
which Frémont and Stockton had taken from Mexico,
gold was discovered in 1848, and in eighteen months
a torrent of 50,000 argonauts had poured across the
isthmus and over the plains, leaving their trail of dead
through the awful grey solitude of the waterless desert.
In the summer of &rsquo;49 there were five hundred vessels
lying in San Francisco harbour,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> where a few years
earlier a single visitor had been comparatively rare.
And at the same hour, on the eastern coast, every port
was a-clamour with men frantically demanding a passage,
and the refrain of the pilgrims&rsquo; song was everywhere
heard,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh, California, that&rsquo;s the land for me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is no indication in Whitman&rsquo;s writings that he
was ever swept off his feet by this fierce tide of adventure.
Anyone who has felt such a current setting
in among the fluid populations of the West is not likely
to underestimate its power. Even in the more staid
and sober East the excitement must have been intense:
and it is, at the first thought, surprising that Walt, who
was still full of youth and strength and ambition,
should have remained at home. On second thought,
however, it is clear that gold-seeking was about the last
enterprise to entice a man who was shortly to relinquish
house-building because he was accumulating money.</p>

<p>The attraction of the new lands may have been strong
when the <i>Freeman</i> released him, but he had had wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>ing
enough for the present, and the attraction of New
York itself was at least as strong. Unlike Joaquin
Miller, who was among the first in each of the new
mining camps which sprang up along the Pacific slopes
during the next fifty years, Whitman remained within
the circle of New York Bay. He was content to see
the vessels being built for their long and hazardous
voyage, strong to take all the buffeting of two oceans&mdash;those
beautiful Yankee clipper ships which have never
been rivalled for grace combined with speed. He was
content to see all the possibilities of that bold frontier
life in the friendly faces of young men leaning over the
bench or driving their jolly teams.</p>

<p>He was not one of those who need to go afield in
order that their sluggish blood may be quickened into
daring, or their dull mood be thrilled with admiring
wonder. Nothing was commonplace to his eyes, and
he found adventures enough to occupy him in any
street. Thus while others were framing new governments
for new communities, he stayed at home and
framed new houses for new families of workmen; and
perhaps after all, in his transcendental fashion, he found
his own work the more romantic. He had a deeply-rooted
prejudice against the exceptional; he planned
for himself the life of an average American of the
middle nineteenth century, no longer geographically a
frontiersman, though more than ever a pioneer in
other fields. He would have taken his pan and washed
for gold in the Sacramento had he wanted; but the
Brooklyn streets and ferry, Broadway and the faces of
New York held him. He had not exhausted them
yet.</p>

<p>He had, moreover, a strongly conservative instinct,
an inclination to &ldquo;stay put,&rdquo; evident in his story from
this time forth. He was not a nomad, forever striking
his tent and moving on; he wanted a settled home, and
attached himself more than most men to the familiar.
He took root, like a tree. The secure immobility of his
base allowed him to stretch his branches far in every
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>His mind, too, we may be sure, was occupied with
its own problems. At first, perhaps, as an inner struggle
with insurgent and rebel thoughts and desires, but now
as an effort of the conscious self to include and harmonise
new elements, and so to lie open to all experience
with equanimity, refusing none. Such a process
of integration in a mind like Whitman&rsquo;s requires years
of slow growth and brooding consciousness, if it is to
be fully and finally achieved. And as the integration
of his character became more and more complete, he
won another point of view upon all things, and, as it
were, saw all things new. It is little wonder that we
have but scanty record of the years from 1850 to 1855.</p>

<p>In his home-life in Brooklyn he was happy and beloved
and able to follow his own path without being
questioned, or, for that matter, understood. He was
probably not quite the easiest of men to live with.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
He had his own notions, with which others were not
allowed to interfere; he never took advice, and was
not too considerate of domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>As to money, which was never too plentiful in the
household, he professed and felt a royal indifference,
in which, one may suspect, the others did not share.
The father was somewhat penurious on occasion and
capable of sharp practice; he had worked hard and incessantly,
and had known poverty; the youngest son,
moreover, would always be dependent upon others, and
Jesse, the oldest, seems to have displayed little ability.
One can understand that the father and his second son&mdash;who,
with the largest share of capacity, must have
seemed to the old man the most given over to profitless
whims and to idle pleasures&mdash;had not always found it
easy to live together, and that in the past the mother,
with her good sense and understanding of them both,
had often had to mediate between them. In the later
years, however, Walt understood his father thoroughly
and himself better, so that their relationship became
as happy as it was really affectionate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>His knowledge of the world, his coolness in a crisis,
his deliberate balancing of the facts, and yet more deliberate
and confident pronouncing of judgment, made
him an oracle to be consulted by his family and the
neighbours on every occasion of difficulty. The sisters
and younger brothers were all fond of him; he was
more than good-natured and kind, and never presumed
upon his older years to limit their freedom of action or
thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man&rsquo;s kindliness and benignity are admirably
suggested in the portraits taken in his thirty-sixth
year, the earliest that we have. One in particular&mdash;that
chosen for the frontispiece of this book&mdash;is almost
articulate with candour and goodwill. In many respects
it is the most interesting of the hundred or more portraits
extant. Whitman was an excellent sitter, especially
to the camera. His photographs give you a glance of
recognition, and rarely wear the abstracted look, the
stolidity, which is noticeable in several easel pictures.</p>

<p>The daguerrotype of 1854 is the most speaking of
the whole series. It is an absolutely frank face, by no
means the mask which, according to the sitter himself,
one of the later portraits shows. It is frank, and it is
kindly, but how much more! The longer one gazes at
it the more complex its suggestions become. The eyes
are not only kind, they are the eyes of a mystic, a seer;
they are a thought wistful, but they are very clear.
Like William Blake&rsquo;s, they are eyes that are good for
the two visions; they see and they are seen through.
If, as I suppose is probable, something of the expression
is due to the fact that the photograph was taken on a
brilliant summer&rsquo;s day, we can only congratulate ourselves
that the elements co-operated with the sitter&rsquo;s
soul.</p>

<p>In striking contrast with the eyes is the good-natured
but loose mouth, a faun-like expression upon its thick
lips, which dismisses at once any fancy of the ascetic
saint. The nose, too, is thick, strong and straight, with
large nostrils. Even in the photograph you can feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
rich and open texture of the skin which radiates the joy
of living from every pore.</p>

<p>It is the face, above all, of a man, and the face of a
man you would choose for a comrade; there would be
no fear of his failing or misunderstanding you. But,
withal, it is the face of a spirit wholly untamed, a
wood-creature if you will, perhaps the face of Adam
himself, looking out upon Eden with divine eyes of
immortality.</p>

<p>Remember, as you meet his gaze, that he knows the
life of cities, and that the Fall lies behind him, not
before. Perhaps that is why some who have looked at
it describe it as the &ldquo;Christ portrait&rdquo;&mdash;for Jesus was
the second Adam&mdash;but this is not the ascetic Christ of
the Churches, the smile about the lips is too full for
that. No, it is the face of a man responsive to all the
appeals of the senses, a man who drives the full team
of those wild horses of passion which tear in pieces less
harmonious souls.</p>

<p>This is a man who saw life whole, and had joy of
it. He knew the life of the body on every side, save
that of sickness, and of the mind on every side, save
that of fear. His large, friendly, attractive personality
was always feeding him with the materials of experience,
and there was nothing in it all which he did not relish.
The responses of his nature to each object and incident
were joyous; for the responses of a harmonious nature
are musical, whatever be the touch that rouses them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A shrewd estimate of Whitman&rsquo;s character had been
made five years before by a New York phrenologist,
and its general accuracy seems to have vanquished the
incredulity of its subject.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Mr. Fowler described him&mdash;I
will translate the jargon of his pseudo-science into
plain English&mdash;as capable of deep friendship and sympathy,
with tendencies to stubbornness and self-esteem,
and a strong feeling for the sublime. He thought that
Whitman&rsquo;s danger lay in the direction of indolence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
sensuality, &ldquo;and a certain reckless swing of animal will&rdquo;.
At the same time he recognised in him the quality of
caution largely developed.</p>

<p>As this estimate was subsequently quoted by Whitman
with approval, and referred to as an authority, it
evidently tallied with his reading of himself, and while
it is by no means remarkable or particularly significant,
it bears out other testimony. That &ldquo;reckless swing of
animal will&rdquo; always distinguished him from the colourless
peripatetic brains and cold-blooded collectors of copy
so numerous in the hosts of journalism. Walt came of
a race of slow but passionate men, and when he was
deeply moved he could be terrible. At such times his
wrath blazed up and overwhelmed him in its sudden
access, but it was as short-lived as it was swift.</p>

<p>It is related<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> that once in a Brooklyn church he failed
to remove his soft broad-brimmed hat, and entered the
building with his head thus covered, looking for all the
world like some Quaker of the olden time. The offending
article was roughly knocked off by the verger. Walt
picked it up, twisted it into a sort of scourge, seized
the astonished official by the collar&mdash;he always detested
officials&mdash;trounced him with it, clapped it on his head
again, and so, abruptly and coolly, left the church. He
was a tall, muscular fellow, stood six feet two, and was
broad in proportion, and could deal effectually with an
offensive person when he felt that action was called for.
Such actions naturally added to his popularity among
the &ldquo;boys&rdquo;&mdash;the stage-drivers, firemen and others&mdash;with
whom he was always a favourite. But, as a rule,
he had no occasion to use his strength in this manner.
He never gave, and rarely recognised, provocation.
There are times, however, when persuasion has to give
place to more summary demonstrations of purpose.</p>

<p>Of his strength, but especially of his health, he was
not a little proud. As a lad, the praise that delighted
him most was that of his well-developed body as he
bathed.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> He did not care to be thought handsome; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
knew that wholesomeness and health were really more
attractive, and he was content with his own perfect
soundness. He was never ailing, even when, in his &rsquo;teens,
he outgrew for a time his natural vigour. In middle
life it was his boast that he could not remember what
it was to be sick. Vanity is so natural in the young
that when properly based it is probably a virtue, and
there can be no question that Walt&rsquo;s was well-founded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is something more, however, in the portrait I
have been describing than the perfection of physical
health. It is health raised to its highest possibility,
which radiates outward from the innermost seat of life,
potent with the magnetism of personality, through every
pore and particle of flesh. His health, hitherto unbroken,
had been deepened into that sense of spiritual well-being
which, in its fulness, only accompanies the realisation of
harmony or wholeness.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> He had undergone some fusing
process which ended in unity and illumination.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say anything at all adequate about
such an experience, because it appears to belong to the
highest of the stages of consciousness which the race
has yet attained; and because there are many men and
women of the finest intellectual training and the widest
culture to whom it remains foreign.</p>

<p>The petals of consciousness unfold as it were from
within, and every stage of unfolding, being symmetrical,
appears to be perfect. A further evolution is almost inconceivable,
but the flower still unfolds. The healthy
and vigorous personality of the man whose story we are
trying to read, continued its development a stage further
than the general, and at an age of from thirty to thirty-five
established an exceptional relation with the universe.</p>

<p>That exceptional relation is best described as mystical,
though the word has unhappy and unwholesome associations,
which cannot attach to the character revealed in
the portrait. Whitman was almost aggressively cheerful
and rudely healthy. But he was not the less a mystic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
One of the most essentially religious of men, his religion
was based upon profound personal experience.</p>

<p>The character of mystical experience seems to vary
as widely as does that of individual mystics, but it has
certain common features. It is essentially an irruption
of some profounder self into the field of consciousness;
an irruption which is accompanied by a mysterious but
most authoritative sense of the fulness, power and permanence
of this new life. Consequent upon this life-enhancement,
come joy and ecstasy.</p>

<p>The whole story of the development of consciousness
is, as I have said, a process of unfoldings; but there is
one critical moment of that process which occurs sometimes
after the attainment of maturity, of such infinite
significance to the individual that it seems like a revolution
rather than a mere development in consciousness.
It is often described as conversion. Whitman&rsquo;s experience
was fully as significant and wonder-compelling as
any; but momentous as it was, its nature compelled
him to regard it as a further and crowning step in a long
succession of stairs&mdash;a culmination, not a change of
direction. With it he came to the top of the slope and
looked over, on to the summit, and beheld the outstretched
world. It was no turning round and going
the other way; it was the rewarding achievement of a
long and patient climb.</p>

<p>But the simile of the mountain-side hardly suffices,
for this was a bursting of constraint&mdash;a breaking, as
well as a surmounting of barriers; as though the
accumulating waters in some dark and hidden reservoir
should so increase in volume that they burst at
last through their confining walls of rubble and of
rock, forcing their way upwards in a rush of ecstasy
to the universal life and the outer sunshine. This outlet
of the pent-up floods of emotional experience into
another and a vaster sphere of consciousness&mdash;this
outpouring of the soul from its confinement in the
darkness to the freedom of the light&mdash;results from the
slow accumulation of the stores of life, but it has at
last its supreme hour, its divine instant of liberation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>In this it has its parallel with the passion of Love.
For the inner mysteries of religion and of sex are hardly
to be separated. They are different phases of the one
supreme passion of immanent, expanding and uniting
life; mysterious breakings of barriers, and burstings
forth; expressions of a power which seems to augment
continually with the store of the soul&rsquo;s experience in
this world of sense; experience received and hidden
beneath the ground of our consciousness. To feel the
passion of Love is to discover something of that mystery
breaking, in its orgasm, through the narrow completeness
and separate finality of that complacent commonplace,
which in our ignorance we build so confidently
over it, and creating a new life of communion. To feel
the passion of religion is to discover more.</p>

<p>The relation of the two passions was so evident to
Whitman that we may believe it was suggested to his
mind by his own experience. In some lives it would
appear that the one passion takes the place of the other,
so that the ascetics imagine them to be mutually exclusive;
but this was certainly not Whitman&rsquo;s case. Whitman&rsquo;s
mysticism was well-rooted in the life of the senses,
and hence its indubitable reality. We have seen that
he had had experience of sex-love, and we have found
reasons to aver that it was of a noble and honourable
order; we have seen this experience followed by an
acute crisis and its determination, or at least its suspension,
and change of character.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, the sex-experience had revealed
to Whitman the dominance in his nature of those profound
emotional depths of which he had always been
dimly conscious since the hours on Long Island beach.
The whole crisis had made him realise more fully than
ever the solemnity and mysterious purpose of life. It
had not satisfied him: it had roused in him many perplexities,
and had entailed what was probably the first
great sacrifice of his life. In a word, this obscure and
mysterious page in his story prepared him who read it
for a further emotional revelation, such as I have been
describing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>This actually came to him one memorable midsummer
morning<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> as he lay in the fields breathing the lucid air.
For suddenly the meaning of his life and of his world
shone clear within him, and arising, spread an ineffable
peace, joy and knowledge all about him. The long process
of integration was at last completed. He was at
one with himself, and at peace. It was the new birth of
his soul, and properly speaking, the commencement of
his manhood.</p>

<p>Co-incident with self-realisation came the realisation
of the universe. He saw and felt that it was all of the
same divine stuff as the new-born soul within him; that
love ran through it purposefully from end to end; that
thought could not fathom the suggestions which the
least of things was capable of making to its brother the
soul; that the very leaves of the grass were inspired with
divine spirit as truly as the leaves of any Bible. It was
as though something far larger than that which he had
hitherto regarded as himself had now become self-conscious
in him. He was an enthusiast in the literal sense
of that mystic word, possessed by a god, filled with the
divine consciousness. The Spirit is One, and he was
in the Spirit. It identified him with the things and
objects that hitherto had appeared external to him, and
infinitely increased his sense of their mysterious beauty.
George Fox&rsquo;s description of his own mystical experience
is true, upon the whole, of Whitman&rsquo;s. He writes:
&ldquo;Now was I come up in spirit through the flaming
sword into the Paradise of God. All things were new,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
and all the creation gave another smell unto me than
before, beyond what words can utter.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> When one considers
the Quaker reputation for veracity and caution,
one can hardly doubt that these wonderful words describe
a condition of consciousness similar to that of
Whitman on the June morning of which we speak.</p>

<p>Fox continues that the nature of things lay so open to
him that he was at a stand &ldquo;whether he should practise
physic for the good of mankind&rdquo;. It was by the subtle
sympathy of the Spirit that the first Quaker supposed
himself to be familiar with the medicinal virtues of
herbs, and the same sympathy made Whitman feel that
he understood the purpose of their myriad lives. The
wonder of the universal life was revealed to them both.
They partook of the consciousness which pervades all
matter.</p>

<p>To both men illumination brought a double gift of
vision, vision into the nature of the universal purpose&mdash;of
the spiritual or deeper side of life&mdash;and insight into
the condition and needs of individuals. But in Fox
and Whitman this insight, which seems to predominate
rather in observant than in creative types of genius such
as theirs, was less prominent than the other vision. They
were more largely occupied with the universal than with
the individual; and while their words carry the extraordinarily
intimate message of an appeal to the profoundest
element in each soul, their very universality may have
rendered them often indifferent to the secondary consciousness
or individual self of their hearers. And it is
observable that neither of them evinced anything of that
dramatic gift which seems to require the predominance
of this insight into the secondary self-consciousness.
The impersonality with which as preacher or poet they
made their public appeal, must have made them at times
somewhat inaccessible in their private lives.</p>

<p>Consciousness, it would seem, is of a double nature,
being, as it were, both personal and impersonal&mdash;if we
may use these terms of something that seems after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
to be so wholly personal. And hence it appears contradictory
to itself, and we are forever trying to harmonise
it by the sacrifice of one portion to the other. But in
reality it is one consciousness with two functions: the
first for fellowship and communion, the second for definition
and for concrete achievement.</p>

<p>Whitman developed these two functions harmoniously;
he never sacrificed his individual self-consciousness
to the cosmic. He was just as positively Walt
Whitman the man, as he was Walt Whitman the organ
of inspiration. I think we may say that in the midst of
that mysterious wonder, that extension of himself which
took place at the touch of God, Whitman&rsquo;s own identity,
so far from being lost, was deepened and intensified,
so that he knew instinctively and beyond a doubt that
it was in some sense of the word absolute and imperishable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Earlier in this chapter we viewed philosophy as the
attempt of the Self to apprehend the Not-self as a
Whole; Whitman&rsquo;s revelation was, it seems to me,
the discovery in himself of the sense which does so
apprehend the universe; not as a hypothetical Whole,
but as an incarnate purpose, a life with which he was
able to hold some kind of communion. It was a realisation,
not a theory. Whatever this communion may
have been, it related him to the universe on its spiritual
side by a bond of actual experience. It related him to
the ants and the weeds, and it related him more closely
still to all men and women the world over. The warmth
of family affection was extended to all things, as it had
been in the experience of the Nazarene, and of the little
poor man of Assisi.</p>

<p>But while his sense of relationship to individuals was
thus quickened, the quickening power lay in the realisation
of God&rsquo;s life, and of his own share in it. His
realisation of God had come to him through an ardent
love of individual and concrete things; but now it was
that realisation which so wonderfully deepened and impassioned
his relation to individuals. What we mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
when we use the word God in public, is necessarily
somewhat ambiguous and obscure; but when Whitman
used it, as he did but rarely and always with deliberation,
he seems to have meant the immanent, conscious Spirit
of the Whole.</p>

<p>Theory came second to experience with him, and he
was no adept at definition: the interest he grew to feel
in the Hegelian philosophy and in metaphysics resulted
from his longing, not to convince himself, but to explain
himself intelligibly to his fellows, and, in so far as it
was possible, make plainer to them the meaning of the
world and of themselves.</p>

<p>It seems desirable to define his position a little further,
though we find ourselves at once in a dilemma; for at
this point it is evident that he was both&mdash;or neither&mdash;a
Christian nor a Pagan. He is difficult to place, as
indeed we must often feel our own selves to be, for
whom the idea of a suffering God is no more completely
satisfying than that of Unconscious Impersonal Cosmic
Force. Again, while worship was a purely personal
matter for him, yet the need of fellowship was so profound
that he strove to create something that may not
improperly be described as a Church, a world-wide
fellowship of comrades, through whose devotion the
salvation of the world should be accomplished.</p>

<p>In a profound sense, though emphatically not that
of the creeds, Whitman was Christian, because he believed
that the supreme Revelation of God is to be
sought, not in the external world, but in the soul of
man; because he held, though not in the orthodox
form, the doctrine of Incarnation; because he saw in
Love, the Divine Law and the Divine Liberty; and
because it was his passionate desire to give his life to
the world. In all these things he was Christian, though
we can hardly call him &ldquo;a Christian,&rdquo; for in respect of
all of these he might also be claimed by other world-religions.</p>

<p>As to the Churches, he was not only outside them,
but he frankly disliked them all, with the exception of
the Society of Friends; and even this he probably looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
upon principally as a memory of his childhood, a tradition
which conventionality and the action of schismatics
had gone far to render inoperative in his Nineteenth
Century America. We may say that he was Unitarian
in his view of Jesus; but we must add that he regarded
humanity as being fully as Divine as the orthodox consider
Jesus to be; while his full-blooded religion was
very far from the Unitarianism with which he was acquainted;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
and his faith in humanity exalted the
passions to a place from which this least emotional of
religious bodies is usually the first to exclude them. In
fact, he took neither an intellectual nor an ascetic view
of religion. He had the supreme sanity of holiness in
its best and most wholesome sense; but whenever it
seemed to be applied to him in later years he properly
disclaimed the cognomen of saint, less from humility,
though he also was humble, than because he knew it to
be inapplicable. In conventional humility and the other
negative virtues, renunciation, remorse and self-denial,
he saw more evil than good. His message was one
rather of self-assertion, than of self-surrender. One
regretfully recognises that, for many critics, this alone
will be sufficient to place him outside the pale.</p>

<p>Another test would be applied by some, and though
it would exclude many besides Whitman, we may refer
to it in passing. He was apparently without the sense
of mystical relationship, save that of sympathy, with
Jesus as a present Saviour-God.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> But none the less
he had communion with the Deity whose self-revealing
nature is not merely Energy but Purpose. And his
God was a God not only of perfect and ineffable purpose,
but of all-permeating Love.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Whether his relation to God can be described as
prayer, it is perhaps unprofitable to ask. It is better
worth while to question whether he was conscious of
feeding upon &ldquo;the bread of life,&rdquo; for this consciousness
is a test of communion. Undoubtedly he was; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
nourishment which fed his being came to him as it
were through all media. The sacrament of wafer and
cup is the symbol of that Immanent Real Presence which
is also recognised in the grace before meat. Whitman
partook of the sacrament continually, converting all
sensation into spiritual substance.</p>

<p>The final test of religions, however, is to be found in
their fruits, and the boast of Christianity is its &ldquo;passion
for souls&rdquo;. Now Whitman is among the great examples
of this passion, and his book is one long &ldquo;personal
appeal&rdquo; addressed, sometimes almost painfully, &ldquo;to
You&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, did he aim at &ldquo;saving souls
for Christ&rdquo;? If I understand this very mystical and
obscure question, and its ordinary use, I must answer,
No,&mdash;but I am not sure of its meaning. Whitman&rsquo;s
own salvation urged him to save men and women by
the Love of God for the glory of manhood and of
womanhood and for the service of humanity.</p>

<p>Far as this may be from an affirmative reply to the
question, the seer who has glimpses of ultimate things
will yet recognise Whitman as an evangelical. For he
brought good tidings in his very face. He preached
Yourself, as God purposed you, and will help and have
you to be. Whether this is Paganism or Christianity
let us leave the others to decide; sure for ourselves, at
least, that it is no cold code of ethical precepts and impersonal
injunctions, but the utterance of a personality
become radiant, impassioned and procreative by the
potency of the divine spirit within.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In stating thus the nature of Whitman&rsquo;s vision, I do
not wish to place it too far out of the field of our common
experience. His ordinary consciousness had been touched
by it in earlier hours; and some gleam or glimmer of it
enters every life as an element of romance. But for
most of us, only as a light on the waters that passes and
is gone, not as in Whitman&rsquo;s case, and in the case of
many another mystic whether Pagan or Christian&mdash;for
mysticism is far older and more original than the creeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>&mdash;as
the inward shining and immortal light which henceforward
becomes for them synonymous with health and
wholeness. For most men, the fairy light of childhood
becomes a half-forgotten, wholly foolish memory; Romance
also we outgrow, or cling only to its dead corpse
as to a pretty sentiment. Thus the wonder of our childhood
and our youth, so essentially real in itself, fades
into the light of common day; it becomes for our unbelief
a light that never was on sea or land.</p>

<p>But in Whitman&rsquo;s story we find it living on, to become
transformed in manhood into the soul of all reality. His
wonder at the world grew more. And this wonder,
always bringing with it, to the man as to the child, a
sense of exhilaration and expansion, was at the heart of
his religion, as it is doubtless at the heart of all. No
one will ever understand Whitman or his influence upon
those who come in contact with him, who does not grasp
this fact of his unflagging and delighted wonder at life.
It kept him young to the end. The high-arched brows
over his eyes are its witness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE CARPENTER</p>


<p class="p2">In the fifties a change came over America, a change
preluding the great struggle which ensued. The
population grew rapidly with its former mathematical
regularity; but the settlement and development of the
country went forward even more rapidly. During the
decade, the area of improved land increased by one-half,
and the value of farm property was doubled. The west
bank of the Mississippi being already settled, the future
of the lands still further west between the Missouri and
the Rockies, became of paramount interest to the nation.
It was this problem of the West which strained until it
broke that policy of compromise which for a generation
had bound American politics.</p>

<p>The year 1850 itself is memorable for Clay&rsquo;s opportunist
resolutions in Congress, which were intended to
settle nothing; and for the fierce debates upon them
and upon the Fugitive Slave Bill, in which Webster
and Seward, Calhoun and Jefferson Davis participated.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Clay and Webster died soon after, and their party being
utterly routed at the polls in 1852, finally went to pieces.
The vote of the liberty party had declined, and compromise
still held up its foolish head. But the victorious
Democrats brought all hope of its continuance to an end
by reviving the principle of &ldquo;squatter sovereignty,&rdquo; and
proceeding to apply it in the newly settled lands. It
was their policy to snatch the question of slavery out of
the hands of Congress; for which, as the organ of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
Federal power, they nursed an increasing enmity. The
bloody scenes which drew all eyes to Kansas made it
plain that compromise was done; the South had thrown
it over, and was now half-consciously driving the country
into war.</p>

<p>When the leaders of 1850 died there was no one to
take their places, though the crisis called for men of
counsel and of spirit. President Pierce, of New Hampshire,
the tool of the party machine, merely represented
the political weakness of the nation. It was not till
after the next elections that their new leaders were discovered
by the American people. Judge Douglas, the
champion of &ldquo;squatter sovereignty,&rdquo; rose indeed into
prominence in 1854, but his greater antagonist still remained
comparatively unknown in the country, though
famous in his State and among his neighbours for keen
logic and humorous common-sense.</p>

<p>There was no leadership. Compromise was yielding
not to principle but to the spirit of the mob. Immigration
and the increase of the towns favoured organised
political corruption; and the tyranny of interests and
privileges was beginning to make itself felt on every
hand. When parties are separated by motives of personal
gain rather than by principle, party-feeling finds
expression not in devotion and enthusiasm, but in
violence. It was not only in such newly settled lands
as Kansas, nor alone in such chaotic aggregations of
humanity as were being piled together in New York,
that constitutional methods were abandoned and private
violence was condoned. The spirit of anarchy was
abroad, and members of Congress went armed to the
Capitol itself.</p>

<p>The violence was a natural reaction from the compromise,
and like the compromise was a birth of the
materialistic spirit. America&rsquo;s idealism, so triumphant
at the close of the eighteenth century, had fallen upon
too confident a slumber, and heavily must the Republic
pay for that sleep. A young nation of idealists is doubtless
more subject than any other to these outbreaks of
materialism and its offspring. It is optimistic, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
when it sleeps it leaves no dogs on guard. The nation
becomes engrossed in material tasks, and is presently
surprised by the enemy. But being so surprised, and
fighting thus at disadvantage, it accomplishes more than
the wary old pessimists whose energy is absorbed in
prudence.</p>

<p>American idealism was asleep, but its slumbers were
by no means sound. The voices of Garrison, Emerson
and others mingled troublously with its dreams. And
the pursuit and capture of fugitive slaves like Anthony
Burns, in Boston itself; and the extraordinary sale, both
in America and Europe, of <i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> did much
to quicken that Abolitionist sentiment which in the end
won the day. For the present, however, and until the
third year of the war, abolition remained outside the
region of practical politics. The question which was
dividing the nation was whether slavery should become
a national institution&mdash;whether it should take its place,
as the South intended, as one of the essential postulates
in the theory of American liberty&mdash;or should be restrained
within its old limits as a State institution, an
evil which the Federal Government would never recognise
as necessary to the welfare of America, but which
it was too proud and too generous to compel its constituent
States to abolish. The situation was one of
unstable equilibrium, and the illogical position could not
much longer be maintained. It was the logic of ideas
that first drove the South into secession, and afterwards
the nation into abolition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Immigration was now beginning to create a difficult
problem in the metropolis,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and was in part accountable
for the corruption which from this time forward disfigured
its politics. By 1855 New York counted more
than six hundred thousand inhabitants; a number which
in itself must inevitably have created many a delicate
situation in a new country, but which was rendered tenfold
more difficult to manage by its rapid growth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
heterogeneous character. It had doubled in fifteen years,
and a continuously increasing stream of immigration had
poured through it.</p>

<p>The first great wave had brought nearly two millions
of Europeans, principally Germans and Irish, across the
Atlantic during the later forties. The failure of the
Irish potato crop in 1846, the crisis of 1848, when
Europe was swept by revolution and afterwards by
reaction, sent hundreds of thousands of homeless men
across the sea. Many of the Germans afterwards took
their share in another struggle for freedom in their new
home; but on the other hand, the more helpless of the
immigrants, and a large proportion of the Irish, swelled
the population of New York; and proved themselves
quicker to learn the advantages of party subserviency
than the ethics of citizenship. Many of them had been
trained in the school of tyranny at home. Thus the
city government became almost hopelessly corrupt, falling
into the hands of the genteel and unprincipled Mayor
Fernando Wood,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and Isaiah Rynders, captain of his
bodyguard of blackguards. Men of this stamp began
to control not only the government of New York city,
but the national party which had its headquarters at
Tammany Hall. Whitman was intimate with the condition
of things there,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and knew the men who manipulated
the machine, and pulled the strings at the
nominating conventions. He has described those of
this period in the most scathing words, and has made
it clear that they were among the worst of a bad class.
They did not favour slavery so much as inaction; they
longed only for a continuance of their own good fortune,
desiring to fatten peacefully at the troughs of corruption.
To men like these, ideals seem to constitute a public
danger. And the war which broke over America in 1861
was due as much to the northern menials of Mammon
as to the real followers of Calhoun. It was not only
against the South that America fought&mdash;or rather it was
not against the South itself at all&mdash;but against the hosts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
of those who used her freedom for the accomplishment
of an end antagonistic to hers.</p>

<p>Evidences of the demoralising influence always present
in the life of a great city were thus painfully patent in
New York, especially in the lowest strata, becoming
hourly more debased and numerous. The plutocracy
also began to imitate the showy splendours of Paris
under the second Empire.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But it would be wrong to
assume that corruption and display characterised the
metropolis of the fifties. For in spite of the foreign
influx, and the venality of a considerable class both of
native and of foreign birth, and in spite too of the
snobs, in spite that is to say of the appearance of two
dangerous elements, the very poor and the very rich,
there was still predominant in New York a frank and
hearty democratic feeling. The mass of the people still
embodied much of the true American genius; they
were marked by the friendly, independent and unconventional
carriage which is still upon the whole typical
of the West.</p>

<p>New York was full of large democratic types of manhood.
Notable, even among these, was Walt Whitman.
Even here, he was unlike other men: the fulness of his
spirits, his robust individuality, the generosity of his
whole nature, was so exceptional as to make itself felt.
His figure began to grow familiar to all kinds of New
Yorkers during these years. He was frequently to be seen
on Broadway,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in his favourite coign of vantage, on the
stage-top by the driver&rsquo;s side, a great, red-faced fellow,
in a soft beaver, with clothes of his own choosing, an
open collar like that of Byron or Jean Paul, and a grey
beard. The dress suited him, he was plainly at home
in it, and in those days it was not specially remarkable
or odd; it was the man himself who compelled attention.</p>

<p>On many a holiday through 1853 he might also have
been seen at the International Exhibition or World&rsquo;s
Fair,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> which was held in the Crystal Palace on Sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
Avenue and Fortieth Street, and offered a remarkable
object lesson to the people of New York on the development
of American resources and the value of that
national unity which railroads and machinery were
yearly making more actual. Here America was seen
in all her own natural promise, and also in her relation
to the Transatlantic world.</p>

<p>It was one of those sights which Whitman dearly
loved. The Exhibition taught him far more than books
about the country in which he lived; for his mind was
like a child&rsquo;s in its responsiveness to concrete illustrations&mdash;a
quality which may explain the long strings of
nouns which figure so oddly on many a page which he
afterwards wrote. He loved a medley of things, each
one significant and delightful in itself. A catalogue
was for him a sort of elemental poem; and being
elemental, he sought to introduce the catalogue into
literature. We who live in another and more ordered
world, rarely respond to this kind of emotional stimulus,
which was doubtless very powerful for Whitman, and
cannot but laugh at his attempts to move us by a
chatter of names. It may be we are wrong, and that
another age will smile at us in our turn, though at present
we remain incredulous.</p>

<p>Here, too, he studied such examples as he found of
statuary and painting, arts of which he must hitherto
have been largely ignorant. It is only very old or very
wealthy cities that become treasuries of the plastic arts,
and at this time New York was not yet sufficiently rich,
or perhaps sufficiently travelled, to have accumulated
this kind of wealth. Whitman was not blind to painting,
like Carlyle, for in later years he so appreciated
the genius of J. F. Millet that he used to say, &ldquo;the man
that knows his Millet needs no creed&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a varied experience as teacher, printer, journalist
and editor, Whitman had settled into the life of an American
artisan. He had inherited much of the Dutch realism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
the love of things and of the making of things, from his
mother&rsquo;s side; while on his father&rsquo;s, the associations
with mallet and chisel had been strong from his childhood;
and thus his trade helped him to gather together
the fragments of his identity and weld them into one. As
he was never in any sense its slave, it also provided him
with the means for that constant leisurely study of life
which was now his real occupation. When a house was
off his hands and the money for it assured, he would
take a holiday, extending sometimes over weeks together,
in the remote parts of Long Island.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The open spaces
helped his mood, and the quietness furthered the slow
processes of self-realisation.</p>

<p>While at Brooklyn, he was every day on the ferry, and
almost every evening he was in New York. He read
during his dinner hour, and thought and meditated while
he worked. The physical exercise quieted his brain.
Taken earlier, it might have deadened it; but he was now
a mature man full of thoughts, and well furnished with
experience. What he needed was to assimilate all this
material and make it his own. And while he built
houses, the co-ordinating principle of his personality was
building up for him a harmonious self-consciousness,
which gradually filled out the large and wholesome body
of the man. This gestating process required precisely
the deliberation and open-air accompaniments which
were afforded by his present life&mdash;a life so different from
the confinement and incessant strain and stress which
check all processes of conscious development in most
men and women before they reach maturity. His
nature was emotional, and music played a considerable
part in its development. Always an assiduous opera-goer,
Whitman took full advantage of the musical
opportunities which New York offered him at this time.
In 1850, Barnum had brought Jenny Lind to the Castle
Gardens&mdash;now the Aquarium&mdash;a fashionable resort on
the Battery, and Maretzek of the Astor Opera House,
had replied with Parodi, and Bettini the great tenor.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span></p>
<p>Best of all, in 1853, Marietta Alboni visited the city,
and Whitman heard her every night of her engagement.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
This great singer, whose voice was then in the plenitude
of its power, had been some twelve years before the
public and was already beginning to attain those physical
proportions suggested in the cruel but witty saying that
she resembled an elephant which had swallowed a nightingale.
She was low-browed and of a somewhat heavy
face, though Whitman thought her handsome; but it
was by her voice, not her face, that she triumphed.
Critics found her talent exceptionally impersonal and
even cold, though they confessed that never voice was
more enchanting.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This coldness is rather difficult to
understand, for Whitman, who was a judge in such
matters, felt it to be full of passion, and a passion which
swept him away in the Titanic whirlwind of its power.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
He had found Jenny Lind somewhat immature and her
voice unrewarding, but Alboni awakened and illumined
his very soul, and became, as it were, the incarnation of
music.</p>

<p>The same summer<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Walt took his father, whose
health was failing, on a visit to Huntington, to see the
old home for a last time. Two years later, Walter
Whitman died and was buried in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The family seems to have been living in Ryerton
Street,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> in a house which was the last building on that
side of the town. Beside Walt, there were three unmarried
brothers at home, George and Jeff as well as
Edward; and Hannah, Walt&rsquo;s favourite sister. We
hear little of Jesse, the oldest brother, who appears to
have been a labourer, of Andrew, or of the remaining
sister Mary. Probably they were all married by this
time and living away.</p>

<p>The three at home were the ablest of the brothers,
and doubtless they shared the financial responsibility
between them. The Portland Avenue house, into which
they presently moved, bears witness to their comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>able
circumstances. Walt contributed his share with
his brothers; beyond that he seemed indifferent about
money; he hardly ever spoke of it, and perhaps by way
of contrast with the others, evidently regarded the subject
as of minor importance. Indeed, just as his own
work had really grown profitable and he was on the
way to become rich, he gave up carpentering for good.
This was early in 1855.</p>

<p>Of late he had been more and more absorbed and
pre-occupied; his days off had been more frequent and
numerous, and whatever his immediate occupation he
was continually stopping to write. He seemed to grow
daily more indifferent to opinion, daily more markedly
himself.</p>

<p>The fragments which he wrote in out-of-the-way
places or at work he would read aloud or recite when
by himself, to the waves or to the trees; trying them
over at the opera, on the ferry, or on Broadway, where
in the midst of the city one can be so unobserved and
so unheard in the heart of its hubbub. He must assure
himself that they were without a hint of unreality or of
books.</p>

<p>For he was now deliberately at work upon his great
task, his child&rsquo;s fancy. He was come up into his manhood.
He had, it seemed to him, thoroughly perceived
and absorbed the spirit of America and of his time.
His message had come to him, and he was writing his
prophetic book, his <i>Song of Walt Whitman</i>.</p>

<p>At last, the manuscript was done, and in the early
summer he went to work in a little printing shop on
Cranberry Street, and set up much, perhaps the whole,
of the type jealously with his own hands.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> About the
beginning of July, and a few days only before his father&rsquo;s
death, it was completed. In the <i>New York Tribune</i> for
the sixth of the month, it was advertised as being on
sale at Fowler &amp; Wells&rsquo;s Phrenological Depôt and
Bookstore on Broadway, and at Swayne&rsquo;s in Fulton
Street, Brooklyn. The price was at first two dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
which seems a little exorbitant for so slender and
unpretending a volume, in shape and thickness a mere
single copy of one of the smaller periodicals, bound in
sea-green cloth, with the odd name, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, in
fanciful gilt lettering across its face. It was presently
reduced to a dollar.</p>

<p>The other members of the household took the new
venture very quietly. They had never been consulted
in the matter&mdash;it had been Walt&rsquo;s affair, and only his;
and the father&rsquo;s death must speedily have obliterated
the little mark it made upon their minds.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> &ldquo;Hiawatha&rdquo;
was published about the same time, and a copy found
its way into the house. The mother, turning the pages
of both, considered that if Longfellow&rsquo;s were acknowledged
as poetry, Walt&rsquo;s queer lines might pass muster
too. Brother George fingered the book a little, and
concluded it was not worth reading&mdash;that it was not in
his line anyhow.</p>

<p>Doubtless they were relieved when the writing and
printing were done, thinking that now surely Walt
would return to the ways of mortals. For he had certainly
fallen into the most irregular habits. He lay late
abed, and came down still later to breakfast; wrote for
a few hours, and when the table was being laid for
dinner, took down his big hat and sauntered out, to
return presently after the meal was over and the dishes
cold.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He was not intentionally inconsiderate, but he
was wholly engrossed in his work, and so pre-occupied
that he must often have been tiresome enough.</p>

<p>After dinner he disappeared altogether, spending the
afternoon and evening in his own leisurely way; setting
type, perhaps, on his book at Andrew Rome&rsquo;s little office,
and then going off to the opera or to some friend&rsquo;s; and,
as he came back, staying far into the night in talk with
the young fellows on the ferry, or on one of the East
River steamers. Sometimes Hannah or Jeff might accompany
him, but as a rule he went alone.</p>

<p>If his family anticipated any change in his ways when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
the book was out, they were doomed to disappointment.
The new task was but begun; the methods approved
themselves to his mind and were pursued. He had
weighed everything over again that summer, as soon
as the book was out, going away to the eastern shore of
Long Island for months of thought and solitude.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As one turns the ninety broad pages of the volume,
with their large type, their long flowing lines, their
odd punctuation and occasional slips in orthography,
every detail telling of the individuality behind it, one
feels a little of what it must have meant to its maker.
Five times, they say,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> he wrote and re-wrote, made
and un-made it, and looking back it seemed as though
for seven years it had been struggling with him for
utterance.</p>

<p>He had written tales and verses with the others, but
this book he knew was different from them all. It was
not so much his writing as himself. It was a man,
and, withal, a new sort of man. For better or worse
it was Walt Whitman, a figure familiar enough to the
common people of Brooklyn and New York, familiar
and beloved&mdash;he was not unconscious of his exceptional
power of attraction<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>&mdash;but a Walt Whitman whom, as
yet, they understood very little, who had, indeed, but
recently come to an understanding of himself, and who
was now approaching to speak with them. Here is the
frank declaration of himself, which he proffers to all.
Now, at last, we shall understand one another, he
seems to say.</p>

<p>It was the old, old need for expression, the ultimate
and deepest necessity of man, which urged him to his
task and made its publication possible. Self-revelation
is, of course, continuous and inevitable upon its unconscious
side. It is only when it becomes a deliberate act
that it astonishes the beholder to outcries of admiration
or indignant horror.</p>

<p>Now the passion that overwhelms the poet is near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
akin to the lover&rsquo;s, for he is a lover whose heart is
transfigured by the presence of Beauty, the Beloved,
immanent in his world. And only by a naked avowal
can such passion be satisfied.</p>

<p>There are those, of course, who regard every self-revelation
as an immodesty, and who will and do avert
their eyes from all passion, crying shame. But some
at least of the others, who are well aware of the weakness
of words, and know how few can use them perfectly,
will reverently approach such a confession as
Whitman&rsquo;s; not, indeed, as if it were that of a young
girl, but as that of a man, naïve, yet virile, and of
heroic sanity. And if they feel any shame they will
frankly acknowledge it to be their own.</p>

<p>There is a kind of egoism which all self-revelation
pre-supposes&mdash;the consciousness of possessing something
supremely worthy of giving. This glorious pride
is not incompatible with the profoundest humility, for
it is divine, like the &ldquo;I am&rdquo; of Jehovah, the egoism
of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If self-expression is the outcome of passion, its new
incarnation has some of the wonder which attends a
birth. The most virile of poets must here become as
a woman; and the mystery which, for any mother,
enwraps her first-born, clings for his Muse about her
slender child by the great god of song. And when, as
in the instance of this book of Whitman&rsquo;s, the children
of the Muse betray in every feature the abandonment
of the remote passion in which they were conceived,
one cannot oneself handle them without emotion.</p>

<p>Walt regarded the book with undisguised pride and
satisfaction. Mother-like, he eyed it as the future
saviour of men. He saw it prophetic and large with
destiny for America. He was confident that the public
would be quick to recognise that quality in it for which
they had been so long half-consciously waiting. The
people would read it with a new delight, for surely it
must be dynamic with the joy in which it was written.</p>

<p>He often said in later years that <i>Leaves of Grass</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
an attempt to put a happy man into literature.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Others
may discuss the optimism and the egoism of his pages,
for of both qualities there is plenty in them, but, after
all, they are but secondary there. As to the qualities
themselves, we may hold contrary and even disparaging
opinions of their value, they will certainly at times repel
us. But primarily these pages portray the happy man,
and a strong and happy personality has the divine gift of
attraction. Byron may dominate the whole of Europe
for a generation by the dark Satanic splendour of his
pride; Carlyle may hold us still by his fierce, lean
passion for sincerity; but Whitman draws us by the
outshining of his joy.</p>

<p>Happiness is not less infectious than melancholy or
zeal; and if it is genuine it is at least equally beyond
price. As far as it goes, it seems to indicate that a
man may be perfectly adjusted to this world of circumstances,
which to us appears so often contrary. A happy
and intelligent man of thirty-six, who has looked at life
open-eyed, and is neither handsome, rich nor famous
is worthy of attention. There is something half-divine
about him; and we cannot but hope he may prove to
be prophetic of the race.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some such thought must have been in Emerson&rsquo;s
mind, when a few days after the perusal of <i>Leaves of
Grass</i>, he wrote his acknowledgment to its unknown
author.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The letter has been often quoted, but it is
so significant that I must quote it again. For no other
literary acknowledgment ever accorded to Whitman possesses
anything like equal interest or importance.</p>

<p>Emerson was certainly the most notable force among
American writers at that time; and one might add, the
only figure of anything like the first magnitude. In
Great Britain, the century had already produced the
literature which we associate with the names of Wordsworth,
Coleridge, Scott, Byron, Shelley, Keats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
Carlyle, not to mention the earlier work of Tennyson,
Browning and others. Emerson was the only American
who could venture to claim rank with these, and then
hardly equal literary rank. But in some respects his
influence was greater, for his was certainly the clearest
and fullest expression of the American spirit in letters.
His words are therefore of importance to us:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Concord, Mass&rsquo;tts</span>, <i>21st July, 1855</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am not blind to the worth of the
wonderful gift of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. I find it the most
extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America
has yet contributed. I am very happy in reading it, as
great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I
am always making of what seems the sterile and stingy
nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph
in the temperament, were making our Western wits
fat and mean. I give you joy of your free and brave
thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable
things said incomparably well, as they must be. I find
the courage of treatment that so delights us and which
large perception only can inspire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which
yet must have had a long foreground somewhere, for
such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this
sunbeam were no illusion; but the solid sense of the
book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits,
namely, of fortifying and encouraging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know until I last night saw the book advertised
in a newspaper that I could trust the name as real
and available for a post office. I wish to see my benefactor,
and have felt much like striking my tasks and
visiting New York to pay you my respects.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. W. Emerson.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter Whitman</span>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
<img src="images/i092.jpg" width="578" height="800" alt="Picture of Ralph Waldo Emerson." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">R. W. EMERSON</p></div>
</div>

<p>The epigrammatic style of the sentences, together
with a strong flavour of sentiment, may set the reader
in his turn rubbing his eyes, and wondering whether
Emerson were consciously inditing a mere complimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>tary
letter. But a second perusal renders such an idea
untenable. The epigram and the sentiment were parts
of the Emersonian mannerism. The letter was not
penned in hot haste, after a first glance at the pages; a
delay had taken place between reading and writing.
Moreover, when about this time a visitor called at Concord,
he was sent on his way to Brooklyn as upon a
pilgrimage, with the significant words, &ldquo;Americans
abroad may now come home: unto us a man is born&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Another epigram, uttered perhaps with a gentle smile,
but without a flavour of irony.</p>

<p>Emerson was then a man of fifty-two. The first and
second series of his lecture-essays had been published
more than ten years, and the first volume of his poems
in 1847; he was already famous in England as well as
in America. But though he was in certain quarters the
cynosure of admiration, in others he was the butt of
ridicule. This same year the London <i>Athenæum</i> praised
Irving because, as it said, his fancies were ideal, and not
like Emerson&rsquo;s merely typographical&mdash;because they did
not consist, like the latter&rsquo;s, in the use of verbs for nouns,
in erratic punctuation, tumid epithets, which were startling
rather than apposite, or in foreign forms and
idioms.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>This though milder, is not unlike what many of the
critics were soon to be saying with better reason of
Whitman; and it is interesting to recall that in 1839,
when he was Whitman&rsquo;s age, Emerson was struggling
to escape from the limits of metre into a rhythm that
should suggest the wildest freedom; that should be
&ldquo;firm as the tread of a horse,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> vindicate itself like the
stroke of a bell, and knock at prose and dulness like a
cannon ball; a rhythm which should be in itself a renewing
of creation, because it was the form of a living
spirit. In later years, Emerson seems to have harked
back again to the more regular forms, believing them to
correspond to essential pulse-beats, or organic rhythm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
But his journal contains several little prose poems of
the date of 1855 or 1856, notably the sketch of the &ldquo;Two
Rivers,&rdquo; outlined partly in loose irregular metres.</p>

<p>This search of the Concord prophet after a new free
rhythmical form, must have predisposed him to interest
in such a book as <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, where the laws of metre
are in force no longer. But beyond this, the older man
felt a close kinship with the younger. Whitman had
declared himself unequivocally for the faith in life which
was Emerson&rsquo;s gospel; and he smacked of the soil and
air of America in a way that Emerson could not but
love. Here at last was an actual incarnation of the
ideas he had so long been hurling at the heads of the
American people.</p>

<p>A beautiful and characteristic modesty is evident in
the tone of the letter. Emerson might well have acknowledged
the younger man as a pupil rather than as
a benefactor; it was the same quality as had appeared
in his reply to Frederika Bremer, when, five years earlier,
she had been praising his own verses: &ldquo;The Poet of
America,&rdquo; he answered gravely, &ldquo;is not yet come.
When he comes he will sing quite differently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea of an American poet was &ldquo;in the air&rdquo;. Intellectual
America was in revolt; she would remain no
longer a mere province of Britain; her writers should
shape themselves no more upon merely English models.
Lowell in his &ldquo;Biglow Papers&rdquo; and Longfellow in
&ldquo;Hiawatha&rdquo; were among many who sought to exploit the
literary soil of the New World. Whatever their success
in this, they can hardly be said to have inaugurated a new
literature. No American Muse had yet appeared upon
the Heights of Helicon to spread a new hush over the
world, and by her singing raise the place of song
perilously near to the stars. But though she had not
appeared she was eagerly expected; and Emerson&rsquo;s letter
is like nothing so much as the heralding cry that he had
at last caught a glimpse of her across Whitman&rsquo;s pages.
It was but a glimpse, and he was yet in doubt; he must
come to Brooklyn himself, must meet this fellow face to
face, and see.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">WHITMAN&rsquo;S MANIFESTO</p>


<p class="p2">It is time that we ourselves took a view of the book,
for we must see what Whitman had actually done
during these last months, and gather what further indications
we may as to his general notions of himself and
of the world.</p>

<p>The volume consists of a long preface or manifesto<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> of
the New Poetry, and of twelve poems by way of example.
The preface commences with a description of America,
the greatest of poems, the largest and most stirring of
all the doings of men. &ldquo;Here is action untied from
strings, necessarily blind to particulars and details,
magnificently moving in masses!&rdquo; Here is a nation,
hospitable, spacious, prolific; a nation whose common
people is a larger race than hitherto, demanding a larger
poetry.</p>

<p>He describes the American poet, who is coming to
awaken men from their nightmare of shame to his own
faith and joy. That poet is the lover of the universe,
who beholds with sure and mystic sight the perfection
that underlies all imperfection, for he sees the Whole of
things. Past and future are present to him; and with
them is the eternal soul. &ldquo;The greatest poet does not
moralise or make applications of morals&mdash;he knows the
soul.&rdquo; His readers become loving, generous, democratic,
proud, sociable, healthy, by beholding in his poems the
beauty of these qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Seer as he is, the poet,&rdquo; continues Whitman, &ldquo;is
no dreamer. He sees and creates actual forms....
To speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and
insouciance of animals, and the unimpeachableness of
the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the
roadside is the flawless triumph of art. If you have
looked on him who has achieved it, you have looked on
one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times.
You shall not contemplate the flight of the grey gull
over the bay, or the mettlesome action of the blood
horse, or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk,
or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven,
or the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more
satisfaction than you shall contemplate him. The great
poet has less a marked style, and is more the channel of
thoughts and things without increase or diminution,
and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his
art, I will not be meddlesome, I will not have in my
writing any elegance or effect, or originality, to hang in
the way between me and the rest like curtains.... I
will have purposes as health or heat or snow has, and
be as regardless of observation.... You shall stand
by my side and look in the mirror with me.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>His words never pose before the reader for ornament,
they are living things. And for this very reason, he
follows no models; his thought is living and original;
it must find a new form for its perfect expression, as a
new seed would find new growth and leafage.</p>

<p>The poet appeals to every reader as to an equal,
because in every reader he appeals to the Supreme Soul.
Many may not hear him, but he appeals to all, and not
to a coterie.</p>

<p>Whitman then proceeds to the praise of science.
Knowledge, bringing back the mind from the supernatural
to the actual, brings faith with it; and the soul
is the divinest thing that science discovers in the
universe. He turns to philosophy, and bids her deal
candidly with whatsoever is real, recognise the eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
tendency of all things toward happiness, and cease to
describe God as contending against some other principle.</p>

<p>The poet deals with truth and with the actual. All
else is but a sham and impotent. For everywhere and
always, the soul which is the one permanent reality,
loves truth and responds to it.</p>

<p>The poet is by nature prudent, as one who knows the
real purpose of the soul and of the universe, and would
act in accordance with that knowledge. He accepts the
impulses of the soul as the only final arguments; and
only the deeds which it dictates appear to him to be
profitable. Living in his age, and becoming its embodiment,
he is therewithal a citizen of eternity. The
future shall be his proof: will his song remain at her
heart? Will it awaken, century after century, the divine
unrest, and as it were, create new souls forever?</p>

<p>As for the priests and their work, they are done. The
American poets shall fill their place, and the whole
world shall answer to their message. Their words shall
be in the English tongue&mdash;the language of &ldquo;all who
aspire&rdquo;&mdash;but they shall be the very words of the people
of America; they shall be native to the soil, and redolent
of the air of the Republic. Such poets shall be
America&rsquo;s own, and in them she will welcome her most
illustrious visitors. They are her equals; for the soul
of a man is as supreme as the soul of a nation. And
America shall absorb them as affectionately as they
have absorbed her.</p>

<p>Such is the gist of Whitman&rsquo;s manifesto. Nature the
Soul and Freedom; Simplicity and Originality of Expression&mdash;these,
its dominant notes, recall at once
Rousseau, Wordsworth and Shelley, with many another;
while certain passages remind the reader that <i>The Germ</i>
was but recently published across the sea, the manifesto
of another movement associated with the names of the
Rossetti family and with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
But whatever the reminiscences it awakens,
Whitman&rsquo;s preface is his own. The thoughts were not
all originally his. But they had shaped themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
newly in his brain and under his pen, and every line
bears the stamp of originality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Without staying to discuss the preface let us proceed
to a rapid survey of the remaining pages. They are
written, it would seem, for measured declamation, in a
sort of free chant, which is neither prose nor verse, but
whose lines coincide in length with natural pauses in the
thought. Whitman himself spoke very deliberately, in
a half drawl; he had a melodious baritone voice of considerable
range and power, and one can well imagine
how he would recite, when alone or with some intimate
friend, the first lines, beginning:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I celebrate myself,</div>
<div class="verse">And what I assume you shall assume,</div>
<div class="verse">For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.</div>
<div class="verse">I loafe and invite my soul,</div>
<div class="verse">I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of summer grass.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lines are quite simple and direct; they are intended
to place the reader at once in relation with the
actual idler who recites them in the summer fields. He
is an out-of-doors fellow, who lives whole-heartedly in
the present, rejoicing in the world and observing it. He
and his soul&mdash;he distinguishes decisively between the
temporal and the eternal elements in himself whose
equal balance, neither abdicating its place nor contesting
that of the other, makes the harmony of his life&mdash;he
and his soul commune together, and discover that the
world means Love, and that the very grass is full of
suggestions of immortality.</p>

<p>Everything indeed has its word for Walt Whitman;
he understands what the streets are unconsciously saying;
the animals of the country-side, the working men,
the youths and the women, each and all are teaching
him something of himself. All life appeals to him; he
recognises himself in each of its myriad forms. And his
thoughts are the half-conscious thoughts which lie in the
minds of all. It is not only the happy and prosperous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
whom he represents, but the defeated also, and the
outcast.</p>

<p>All things have their mystical meanings; but especially
are manhood and womanhood divine. There is
nothing more divine than they. As for him, he is proud,
satisfied, august. He has no sympathy with whimperings,
or conformity to the ideas of others. Is not he
himself the fellow and equal of the supreme Beings, of
the Night, the Earth, and the Sea?</p>

<p>He has faith in the issue of time; he fully accepts all
reality as a part of the whole purpose. He at least will
be fearless and frank, and conceal nothing; all desires
shall be expressed by him.</p>

<p>And to him all the bodily functions are wonderful.
His whole life is a wonder and delight, beyond the
power of words to utter. Sounds especially he enjoys;
alluding to the passionate emotions aroused in him by
the opera, and adding an obscure, erotic dithyramb on
the ecstasy of touch, the proof of reality, for we understand
everything through touch.</p>

<p>Everything is seen by him to be full of meaning,
because he himself is a microcosm and summary of the
universe &ldquo;stuccoed with quadrupeds and birds all
over&rdquo;. He feels so vividly his personal kinship with
the animals which are never pre-occupied about religion
or property, that he thinks he must have passed through
their present experience &ldquo;huge times ago,&rdquo; to include it
now in his own.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Forthwith, he strings together in a
rapid succession of dazzling miniatures, some of the
contents of his personal memory; pictures out of his
experience or his imagination, that remain vivid and
significant to him. His sympathy makes them actually
real to him; the figures in them are each a part of
himself. &ldquo;I am the man,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;I suffered, I
was there.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>But he has his own distinct personality. He is the
friendly and flowing savage, full of magnetism, health
and power&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,</div>
<div class="verse">They desire he should like them, and touch them, and speak to them, and stay with them.</div>

<div class="verse">Slow-stepping feet, and the common features, and the common modes and emanations....</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He sees the divine that is in men, and how all the gods
are latent in the race, and with them ever more besides.
Even in the midst of their absurd littleness, which he
fully recognises, he calls men to the reality of themselves,
away from the religions of the priests to their
own souls. He understands doubt very well, but he
has faith, faith in an ultimate happiness for each
and all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He endeavours to express his sense of eternity, and of
the friendliness of the world to him:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span></p>
<p>Thus it seems to him that he has existed potentially
from the beginning; that all the ages in succession have
cared for him, and that now the whole world is full of
his kin and lovers. He beholds the universe as gloriously
infinite in its assured purpose: God has appointed
a meeting-place where He waits for every soul. The
way of the soul is eternal progress, and each one must
follow that road. My pupils, he exclaims, shall become
masters and excel me! They shall be wholesome,
hearty, natural fellows, attracted to me because I
neither write for money nor indoors.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>My religion is the worship of the soul. I am calm
and composed, and satisfied about God, whom I do not
in the least understand. Death and decay seem wholesome
to him; they are the way of life by which he
himself came to the present hour, wherein he realises
the mystic reality, the life eternal, and the ineffable idea
of happiness as the central purpose of the Universe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Do you see, O my brothers and sisters?</div>
<div class="verse">It is not chaos or death&mdash;it is form, union, plan&mdash;it is eternal life, it is happiness.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With an enigmatical farewell, he resumes his place in
the life of the world, awaiting such of his readers as
belong to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>The other poems are pendants to the first, offering
further exemplifications of the precepts of the preface.
He appeals, for example,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> to his fellow workmen and
workwomen, that they realise their own greatness and
immortality, their own individual destiny; for nothing
can ever be so worthy of their reverence as their own
soul.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span></p>
<p>He bids them employ and enjoy this hour to the
full,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> for death comes, and it will not be the same as
life. Yet death also will be good to the soul&mdash;all the
signs assure the soul that it will be satisfied; and there
is nothing which does not share in the soul-life.</p>

<p>In dreams<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> he recognises some free utterances of the
soul, and in sleep, the great equaliser of men. As he
watches them asleep all become beautiful to him with
the beauty of the soul, which men also call Heaven.
Diseased or vile they may be, but their souls forever
urge them along the appointed way towards the goal.
He seems to see all souls meeting together in sleep,
mysteriously to circle the earth, hand in hand. He
entrusts himself to sleep with the same security as to
Death and Birth.</p>

<p>At the sight and touch of the human body,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> he kindles
with the delight of a Renaissance painter, a Botticelli or
a Michael Angelo. The very soul loves the flesh, and
the contact of flesh with flesh rejoices it. He writes of
the magic force of attraction embodied in a woman;
nor of attraction only, but of emancipation. He extols
the strength and joy which is embodied in a man. The
body of every man and woman, says he, should be as
sacred to you as your own, for the body is almost the
soul, and to desecrate the bodies of the dead is a little
thing beside the shame that we put upon the bodies of
the living.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">If life and the soul are sacred, the human body is sacred,</div>
<div class="verse">And the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted,</div>
<div class="verse">And in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body,</div>
<div class="verse">Is beautiful as the most beautiful face.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He fills a page<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> with quick Hogarthian sketches of the
lower types of faces, and then, turning about, acclaims
the souls behind them as his equals. They too will
duly come to themselves, following towards the light,
after the Lord.</p>

<p>He loves thus to enlarge upon the poet&rsquo;s office as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
the Answerer<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> or sympathiser with all men, and how he
should be welcome and familiar to each. In the poet&rsquo;s
company, the soul of each one quickens. And yet the
poet is no greater than the least; his verses are not
nobler than the kindly deed of any poor old woman.</p>

<p>He writes of 1848, the year of Revolutions,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> somewhat
in the style of &ldquo;Blood Money,&rdquo; and probably this page
is one of the earliest of the fragments, and may date
back to the year which it celebrates. In spite of the
successes of tyranny, and the failures of the young men
of Europe, he sees that Liberty herself is never foiled.</p>

<p>By way of sharp contrast<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> he directs a mocking and
colloquial page of satire against the &rsquo;cute Bostonians
of 1854. Whitman&rsquo;s dislike of Boston is never for a
moment concealed; Jonathan the Yankee he detests.
And now he brings home to him the profits of his
bargaining; he has dethroned King George only to set
up in his place this Republican President, Pierce of
New Hampshire, who in these loud-echoing streets
employs the strength of America upon the capture of
a fugitive slave.</p>

<p>Sometimes he is autobiographical.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> &ldquo;There was a
child went forth,&rdquo;&mdash;he recites&mdash;a country boy who, at
West Hills and in Brooklyn, absorbed all the sights and
sounds of his world into himself; till the early lilacs,
the morning-glories, and the orchard blossom, the
quarrelsome and the friendly boys and the bare-footed
negro-children all became a part of him. His parents,
too, in the daily life of the home as well as by heredity,
entered into his make-up; the mother, wholesome,
quiet and gentle, the father, virile and hot-tempered,
with a streak of craft and astuteness running through
him. And as they became a part of me, he says, so
now they shall become a part of you that read this
page.</p>

<p>Or at his naïvest, we see him standing open-mouthed
and amazed, like a very child, before the sheer naked
facts of his own story from the date of his birth to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
present hour;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and endeavouring to evoke a similar
naïve attitude in the reader, not indeed towards the
date of Whitman&rsquo;s birth, but towards that of his own.</p>

<p>Upon a kindred note we turn the last page also<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>&mdash;for
it is a proclamation of reverence, reverence for all
the old myths; reverence for the high ideals; reverence
too for Youth and for Age, for Speech and Silence, for
true Wealth and true Poverty, always with stress upon
the last member of each pair; for America, too, and for
the Earth with its ineffable future; for Truth, for Justice,
for Goodness&mdash;ay, and, he adds with conscious paradox,
for Wickedness as well; above all for Life, but not less
for Death. Great is Life, he concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Great is Life, real and mystical wherever and whoever:</div>
<div class="verse">Great is Death:&mdash;sure as Life holds all parts together, Death holds all parts together:</div>
<div class="verse">Sure as the stars return again after they merge in the light, Death is great as Life.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How are we to sum up these pages, and figure out
what it is they come to? No summary is likely to do
justice to a book of poetry, which demonstrates itself by
wholly other methods than argument, and it would be
foolish for me to attempt it. But there is one point
with which I must make shift to deal.</p>

<p>Beginning with a forecast of the New Poetry, as of
something which should be in its essence indigenous to
America, the natural expression of a new spirit and race
and of its attitude towards the Self and the Universe,
Whitman has boldly given examples to show what it
was he meant. What are we to say of these? Do they
give us a new art-form? or, if you will, a new kind of
poetry? Do they bring us material for some new law
of rhythm or metre?</p>

<p>These are deep questions, and dangerous to answer.
For myself, I can but give an affirmative to them,
accepting the smiles of the incredulous. And I must
do so without a discussion which would here be tedious,
even if I were able to make it profitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>There is a simple test of the whole matter which one
may oneself apply: Does Whitman&rsquo;s method of writing
arouse, in those who can read it with enjoyment, an
emotion distinct in character from that aroused by the
methods of all other poets? Does <i>Leaves of Grass</i> awake
some quality of the Soul which answers neither to the
words of Tennyson nor Browning, Emerson nor Carlyle?
The proof by emotional reaction requires some skill
in self-observation and more impartiality; but, on the
whole, I think those who have tried it fairly seem to
take my part, and to answer emphatically in the affirmative.</p>

<p>What then is this emotion which Whitman alone, or
in special measure, evokes? It is a further hard but
fair question, for it involves Whitman&rsquo;s personality, and
this book is an attempt to answer it. Briefly, it is the
complex but harmonious emotion which possesses a
sane full-blooded man of fully awakened soul, when he
realises the presence of the Eternal and Universal incarnate
in some &ldquo;spear of summer grass&rdquo;. One may
call it the religious emotion; but it is not the emotion
of any other religious poetry, saving perhaps some of
the Hebrew prophets: and every prophet has his own
cry. It is the emotion of a religion which is as large as
the largest conceptions which man has yet formed of
life; for Whitman, apart from any limitations in his
thought, appears to have lived more fully and with
fuller conscious purpose than did other men.</p>

<p>In order to make oneself understood at all one speaks
in hyperbole, and doubtless I exaggerate. Whitman
was, of course, no God among men, nor was he greater
than other poets; in a sense he was even less than the
least of them, so subjective was his genius; but since
he consciously evokes a new emotion, he has his place
among true artists, for Art is the power of evoking the
emotion in others which one intends. And since the
new emotion seems to be altogether ennobling when it
is fully realised, being at once enlarging and integrating
to the soul, we ought the more gladly to hail and
acknowledge him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>I say a new emotion, not meaning, of course, that he
is alone in calling up the soul, for no great poetry can
leave the soul unstirred; but that no poetry of modern
times stirs the soul in the same manner as does that of
this full-natured man. So far, I think, we may acknowledge
Whitman&rsquo;s success as a poet, and I am not concerned
to urge it further. There are many who do not
respond to his writings in the way I have indicated, and
they naturally refuse him the title. There are others
who do, and who accord it to him; and I confess I am
of the latter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The only American poet who approaches him in sentiment
is Emerson. Poems like &ldquo;Each and All,&rdquo; with
its motive of the cosmic unity, &ldquo;The perfect Whole,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Brahma,&rdquo; with its reconciling all-inclusiveness, are very
near in thought to Whitman; so again is &ldquo;Merlin&rdquo;
with its</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse14">Great is the art,</div>
<div class="verse">Great be the manners of the bard;</div>
<div class="verse">He shall not his brain encumber</div>
<div class="verse">With the coil of rhyme and number,&mdash;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>or &ldquo;Woodnotes&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;God hid the whole world in thy
heart&rdquo;&mdash;or the exclamation &ldquo;When worlds of lovers
hem thee in&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Threnody&rdquo;; or his &ldquo;Test,&rdquo; when
he hangs his verses in the wind. The inspiration of the
two men made them akin; but it was far from identical.
There are sides of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> which are absent
from Emerson&rsquo;s writings, just as there are phases of
Emerson&rsquo;s thought which are never really touched by
Whitman. But above all, while the works of both are
exhilarating to the soul, the emotional reactions from
them are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Considering Emerson&rsquo;s influence at the time upon all
that was most virile in American thought, we might
feel certain that some part at least of his teaching had
illuminated Whitman&rsquo;s mind, and there is sufficient
evidence in his own writings to prove it.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> He said
indeed, that it was Emerson who led him to a spiritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
understanding of America, and who finally brought his
simmering ideas to the boil.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But he also vehemently
asserted the independence of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> from any
direct Emersonian or other literary influence; and
in this the internal evidence of his book supports him.
It is really impossible to confuse the flavours of Whitman
and of Emerson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more comparison, and I will pursue the story.
There is much which Whitman obviously shares with
Shelley. Their kinship of inspiration is too significant
for a passing note, and might well be followed over
many pages. The writer of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and the
youthful author of <i>Queen Mab</i>, had drunk at the same
fountain of love and wonder.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Shelley&rsquo;s <i>Defence of Poetry</i> should be read alongside of
the Preface of 1855. In it also you will find it stated
that the poet lives in the consciousness of the whole;
that he is not to be bound by metrical custom, the
distinction between poets and prose-writers being but
a vulgar error; it is sufficient if his periods are harmonious
and rhythmical. Poetry is therein discovered
as the great instrument of morality, for it exercises
and therefore strengthens the imagination, which is the
organ of love&mdash;that going-out of a man from himself to
others, in which morality finds the final expression.</p>

<p>Here, as in Whitman&rsquo;s pages, the permanence of
poetry is asserted; its significance is not to be exhausted
by the generation in which it found expression.
Poetry is the motive power of action and creates
utilities. It is the root and blossom of science and
philosophy. Poetry is the interpenetration of a diviner
nature with our own; it turns all things to loveliness,
and strips off that film of use and wont which holds
our eyes from the vision of wonder. The great poets
are men of supreme virtue and consummate prudence.
They are the world&rsquo;s law-givers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>It must be enough for us to have noted the parallel,
which might easily be pressed too far. There are regions
of thought and expression in which their opposition
would, of course, appear even more striking; we
need not pursue the subject, remembering that much
of what they share derives from the influence which
we associate with the works of Rousseau.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whatever our opinion of Whitman&rsquo;s astonishing
&ldquo;piece of wit and wisdom,&rdquo; we cannot be surprised
that in some quarters it was received with contemptuous
silence, and in others with prompt and frank
abuse. The <i>Boston Intelligencer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> for instance, credited
it to some escaped lunatic; the <i>Criterion</i><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> to a man
possessed of the soul of a sentimental donkey that had
died of disappointed love; while the <i>London Critic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> comparing
him to Caliban, declared he should be whipped
by the public executioner.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, more astonishing that some of the
leading journals and reviews of America&mdash;the <i>North
American Review</i>, <i>Putnam&rsquo;s Monthly</i>, and the <i>New York
Tribune</i><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>&mdash;for example, noticed the book at some length
and with friendly forbearance, if not with actual acclamation.
The first of these gave the book, in its
January issue (1856), three pages of discriminating
welcome from the pen of Edward E. Hale, a religious
minister of liberal mind and warm heart, whose own
inner experience was not without resemblance to Whitman&rsquo;s
in its harmonious development and absence of
spiritual conflict.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Whitman was probably prepared for the abuse; it
was the indifference of the public which astonished
him. At first, it would seem, there was no sale whatever
for the book;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and Emerson was the only one of
its readers who found it specially significant.</p>

<p>Having spent the summer months in solitude in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
country,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Whitman decided upon a somewhat questionable
method of advertisement: he contributed unsigned
notices of his book to the <i>Brooklyn Times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> with
which he appears to have been connected,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and to a
phrenological sheet issued by Fowler and Wells, his
agents on Broadway. He fortified himself<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> for his
task by observing that Leigh Hunt had written for the
Press upon his own work, and even claimed the high
example of Dante.</p>

<p>These articles, whose anonymity seems to infringe on
the impartiality of the Press, and to be in some sense a
breach of journalistic honour, are not a little astonishing.
That in the phrenological journal may, perhaps, be
dismissed as a mere publishers&rsquo; circular or puff, contributed,
as such things frequently are, by the writer.
As to the other, Whitman was for a while the editor of
the <i>Brooklyn Times</i>, and may have written on himself
while serving in this capacity, or perhaps at the request
of the actual editor, doubtless his personal friend. Or,
again, if we would excuse, or rather explain, his action,
we may regard the reviews as his own attempt to look
impersonally at his work.</p>

<p>Whatever we may think of the moral aspect of the
notices, or however we may account for them, they
have considerable interest as further expositions of his
purpose, re-inforcing the Preface after an interval of
meditation. As such, and as a corrective of popular
misapprehensions, he doubtless intended them. In
these pages he lays special emphasis on the American
character of his work. He notes his studied avoidance
of all foreign similes and classical allusions. He compares
himself with Tennyson and other poets, only to
declare that he is alone in understanding the new
poetry, which will not aim at external completeness
and finish, but at infinite suggestion; which will be
an infallible and unforgettable hint&mdash;a living seed, not
merely of thought, but of that emotional force which
is of the Soul and alone can mould personality.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">THE MYSTIC</p>


<p class="p2">In September, 1855, Mr. Moncure Conway, having
heard of Whitman during a visit to Concord,
called upon him in Brooklyn, with an introduction from
Emerson. Walt was then living with his family in one
of a row of small artisans&rsquo; houses, in Ryerton Street,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
out of Myrtle Avenue. At the moment, however, he
was correcting proofs in the little office where his book
had been printed, and wore a workman&rsquo;s striped blue
shirt, open at the throat. A few days later, he called
upon Mr. Conway, his sister and another lady, at the
Metropolitan Hotel, where his manners and conversation
were enjoyed and approved. He was then garbed
in &ldquo;the baize coat and chequered shirt&rdquo; in which he
appears in the <i>Leaves of Grass</i> portrait.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway in his story has somewhat confused the
details of these visits with those of another paid by him
upon a Sunday morning some two years later, when the
Whitmans seem to have moved to a more commodious
house on North Portland Avenue. The matter is not
important, and we may follow the main lines of the
picturesque account which he contributed in October,
1866, to the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>According to this narrative, Whitman was discovered
basking in the hot sunshine on some waste land outside
Brooklyn. He was wearing the rough workman&rsquo;s
clothes of his choice, was as brown as the soil and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
grey as the grass bents. His visitor was at once impressed
by the exceptional largeness and reality of the
man, and by a subtle delicacy of feeling for which <i>Leaves
of Grass</i> does not appear to have prepared him. Whitman
was slow, serene, gracious; in spite of the grey in
his hair and beard, and the deep furrows across his
brow, his full red face and quiet blue-grey eyes were
almost those of a child.</p>

<p>Returning to the house, the visitor noticed a quality
about him which belonged by rights to the line-engraving
of Bacchus which hung in the bare room he
occupied. Like a Greek hero-god, he made one ask
oneself whether he was merely human. And after
crossing the bay with him, and bathing and sauntering
along the beach of Staten Island, the visitor seems to
have left in a condition of almost painful excitement,
unable to give his thought to anything but Whitman.</p>

<p>A few days later, according to this account, Conway
found him setting type for the next edition of his book.
Although he was still writing occasionally for the press,
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> continued to provide his principal occupation.
They crossed the ferry together and rambled
about New York. Nearly every artisan they met greeted
Walt affectionately as an old friend, and not one of them
knew him as a poet.</p>

<p>Together they went to the Tombs prison, Whitman
always having acquaintances among the outcasts of
society, and often visiting them in detention, both here
and at Sing-Sing. Here, Conway had an opportunity
of estimating the power over others which was wielded
by this personality, whose latent force had so much
moved himself. The prisoners confided in him, and on
behalf of one he interviewed the governor of the prison.
The victim had been detained for trial on some petty
charge in an unhealthy cell. Whitman repeated the
man&rsquo;s story, and characterised it, with a sort of religious
emphasis and deliberation, as a &ldquo;damned shame&rdquo;. It
was manifestly upon the tip of the official tongue to
rebuke Walt for impertinence; but though he was
dressed as an artisan, his quiet determined gaze was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
too much for the autocrat, who gave way before it and
ordered the prisoner to be transferred to better quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Other distinguished visitors called on him from time
to time. Of Emerson&rsquo;s own visits we know next to
nothing, but they were frequent and very welcome,
sometimes ending with a dinner at Astor House. We
have a glimpse of Lord Houghton, sharing a dish of
roast apples with his friendly host.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Ward Beecher,
the famous Brooklyn preacher, was among the callers;
and it was on their way from his church that, on Sunday,
9th November, 1856, Mrs. Whitman, in her son&rsquo;s
absence, received Bronson Alcott and Thoreau.</p>

<p>Both men belonged to the circle of Emerson&rsquo;s Concord
intimates, and both have left a record of the successful
renewal of their visit upon the following day.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
The lovable, mystical, oracular Alcott, the delight of his
friends, seems to have been greatly attracted by Whitman,
whom he knew already, and of whom he has
spoken in terms of the highest praise. The mother, he
found on that first visit, stately and sensible, full of
faith in her son &ldquo;Walter&rdquo;; full, too, in his absence, of
his praises, as being from his childhood up both good
and wise, the faithful and beloved counsellor of brothers
and sisters.</p>

<p>They spent two delightful hours with Walt next day,
a Philadelphia lady accompanying them and sharing
their intercourse with &ldquo;the very god Pan,&rdquo; as Alcott
styles him. The conversation was to have been renewed
on the morrow, but Walt failed to put in an
appearance. He was apt to be vague about such appointments,
and one could never be sure that he felt
himself bound by them. Like a Quaker of the old
school, he followed the direction of the hour, and his
promises were tentative and well guarded.</p>

<p>Thoreau, too, the naturalist philosopher of Walden,
wrote down his impressions of the interview. He was
puzzled by Whitman, finding him in many ways a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
strange and surprising being, outside the range of his
experience. Rough, large and masculine but sweet&mdash;essentially
a gentleman, he says; but the title is paradoxical
and inappropriate, and he qualifies it immediately
by adding that he was coarse not fine. As to the last
point, after vigorously debating it, Whitman and he
appear to have retained contrary convictions. But
Whitman himself would have been the first to disclaim
refinement, a quality which he associated with sterility.
If Thoreau had said he was elemental, we would not
now dissent.</p>

<p>They were not likely to understand one another.
The two men present a remarkable contrast, though on
certain sides they have much in common. Thoreau was
about two years the older; his principal book of essays,
called <i>Walden</i> after the site of his hermitage, had been
published when he was about Whitman&rsquo;s age. Physically
he was most unlike the genial red-faced giant
opposite to him. Slight and rather short, with long
arms and sloping shoulders; mouth, eyes and nose
seemed to tell of solitary concentrated thought. There
was something in his face of the frontiersman, that
woodland look one sees also in Lincoln&rsquo;s portraits;
something, too, of the shyness wood creatures have.</p>

<p>He disliked and avoided the generality of men. In
this he would compare himself with Emerson, who
found society a refuge from the shabbiness of life&rsquo;s
commonplace, while Thoreau&rsquo;s own resource was always
solitude. He was continually being surprised by the
vulgarity of himself and of his fellows, continually
flushing with shame, personal or vicarious; and he
sought and found a refuge in the pure and lonely spirit
that haunted Walden Pool.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Whitman, on the other hand, though he loved solitude,
seems, even in solitude, to have craved for movement.
In this he was very far from the orientalism of Thoreau
and its strenuous seeking after peace. He loved progress.
His genius belonged not to the forest pool, whose re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>flections
were unrippled by a breeze&mdash;the mirror of the
abstract mind&mdash;but to the surging passion of the ocean
beach.</p>

<p>Similarly, in his attitude towards men, he was far
removed from both Thoreau and Emerson. Emerson
confessed he could not quite understand what Whitman
so enjoyed in the society of the common people; and
many a Democrat, if he were only as honest, would
make the same confession. It was not that Emerson
was in any sense of the word a snob; but the emotional
side of his nature responded but feebly to certain of the
elemental notes whose vibration is felt perhaps more
frequently among the common people than elsewhere.
Emerson&rsquo;s fellowship was largely upon intellectual
fields: Whitman&rsquo;s almost wholly upon the more
emotional.</p>

<p>Thoreau found society in disembodied thought, and
emotional fellowship in the woods. But to Whitman
the sheer contact with people, and especially the unsophisticated
natural folk of the class into which he was
born and among whom he was bred, was not only a
pleasure but a tonic which he could barely exist without.
In solitude, he became after a time, heavy, inert, lethargic.
His mind itself seemed to grow stale. He was a
mere pool of water left upon the beach, which loses
virtue in its stagnant isolation.</p>

<p>Whitman seems to have been exceptionally conscious
of the stream of electric life which is the great attractive
power of a city, and which in itself tends to draw all
young men and women into its current. It buoyed him
up and carried him, giving him a sense of exaltation
only to be compared with that which other poets
have derived from the mountains, or the wind out of
the West. His large body and intuitive mind craved
for the magnetic stimulus and suggestion of people
moving about him; he did not look to them to save
him from the commonplace, nor did he shrink from
them as bringing him new burdens of a common shame.</p>

<p>Coarse, actual, living humanity was his supreme
interest and passion. And the delicacy and refinement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
of the scholar was dreadful to him, because it separated
him instantly from the vulgar and common folk. He
was one of the roughs, he used to say; and so he was,
but with a difference. It was this that puzzled his
Concord friends who were quick to feel but slow to
understand it. Their perplexity did not, however, turn
into mistrust; for their appreciation of all that they
understood was full and generous.</p>

<p>Thoreau hardly knew whether he was more repelled
or attracted by this &ldquo;great fellow&rdquo; who seemed to be
the personification of Democracy.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Like Tennyson at
a later date, he was unable to define him, but stood convinced
that he was &ldquo;a great big something&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> A little
more than human, Thoreau added; meaning a little
larger than normal human development.</p>

<p>In any case, the man was an enigma. He wrote of
those relations between men and women for which the
poets choose the subtlest and most delicate words in
their treasury, in syllables which seemed to Thoreau
like those of animals which had not attained to speech.
Yet even so, he spoke more truth, beast-like as his voice
sounded, than the others. And Thoreau frankly reminded
himself, if Whitman made him blush the fault
might not be Whitman&rsquo;s after all.</p>

<p>They did not talk very much or very deeply, as there
were four to share the conversation. Thoreau, too, was
in a rather cynical mood, and spoke slightingly of
Brooklyn and America and her politics, which in itself
was enough to chill the stream of intercourse. But
they found a common interest in the Oriental writers
with whom Whitman was but vaguely acquainted, the
scholar advising upon translations. Thoreau and
Emerson had both noted the resemblance between
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> and some of the sacred writings of India;
and the latter once humorously described the <i>Leaves</i> as
a mixture of the <i>Bhagavad-Gitá</i><a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and the <i>New York Herald</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Thoreau died in 1862, and this was probably their only
meeting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thoreau carried off with him a copy of the new
edition of Whitman&rsquo;s poems, fresh from the press, and
some of the remarks I have alluded to refer especially to
its contents, and to several of the new poems which we
must now briefly consider, for it is obviously impossible
to give any worthy account of Whitman without attempting
at least to outline the successive expressions
of his own views about himself, as they are set forth in
his book.</p>

<p>None of the twenty new <i>Leaves</i> appears so important
as the &ldquo;Song of Myself,&rdquo; but among them are some of the
finest and most suggestive pages he ever wrote, notably
the &ldquo;Poem of Salutation,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Poem of the Road&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
The book is now shorn of its prose preface, which
would be a serious loss if large portions of it were not
to be found broken into lines, and otherwise slightly
altered, upon the later pages. It had been used as a
quarry for poems, and some of the blocks underwent
but little trimming.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Salutation,&rdquo; he identifies himself elaborately
and in much detail, with all peoples of the globe, finding
equals and lovers in every land. The universal survey
is faithfully made; the poem is like a rapid passage
through a gallery of pictures, and regarded as a whole,
suggests the outlines of the world-wide field which its
author desires the reader to view. Whitman asserts
his comprehensive sympathy; like America he includes
all men. He is one with them in their common humanity,
and sympathises with them individually in the main
purposes and desires of their lives.</p>

<p>The poem opens in the form of question and answer.
Looking into Whitman&rsquo;s face, the questioner sees as it
were a whole world lying latent within his gaze and
becoming actual as he looks. Taking the poet&rsquo;s hand,
he begs him to explain: Walt accedes with readiness,
and immediately forgets the questioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The subject of the poem&mdash;man as the microcosm not
only of the universe but of the Race&mdash;is not perhaps
novel; but its meaning is none the less difficult to
expound. For it bears directly upon the cosmic consciousness,
in which, as I have said, many of us are
wanting. There are some, however, who are at times
aware of moods in which they realise the symbolic
character of all objects; they see them, that is to say,
as forms through which vivid emotions are conveyed to
the soul. At such moments, the whole world becomes
for them a complex of these symbols, whose authenticity
they can no more doubt than the meaning of daily
speech, and whose ultimate significance is of an infinite
content, which forever unfolds before them.</p>

<p>Such moods were evidently frequent with Whitman,
and perhaps became the norm of his consciousness. In
them his eyes read the world, as though it were the
writing of that infinite and supreme Soul which was
himself, and yet not himself; that Soul of All, with
which his consciousness was become mystically one.
He felt the actual thrill and meaning of the World&rsquo;s
Words; words which he more fully describes or rather
tries to suggest, in another poem, afterwards known as
the &ldquo;Song of the Rolling Earth&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> In order to explain
Whitman&rsquo;s meaning one would need to make a study
of the roots of this kind of symbolism, a task which
is here impracticable. We must be content instead
with a glance at the poem itself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&ldquo;Earth, round, rolling, compact&mdash;suns, moons, animals&mdash;all these are words to be said,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>he asserts; vast words, not indeed of dots and strokes,
nor of sounds, but of real things which exist and are
uttered. I myself, and not my name, he says suggestively,
is the real word which the Soul understands.
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear, not my words
but Me, The Word. The words of great poets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
different from those of mere singers and minor poets,
because they suggest these ultimate words, these
presences and symbols. A symbol, be it remembered,
always using the word in the sense indicated, is no
arbitrary sign, it is a form or appearance, which seen
<i>through</i> the eye&mdash;to use Blake&rsquo;s happy formula&mdash;presents
to the imagination an unimpeachable, distinct
emotional concept.</p>

<p>To Whitman, everything became thus symbolic. He saw the Earth
itself&mdash;the whole world about him&mdash;as a symbol, infallibly presenting
to him a distinguishable idea or meaning; not indeed a thought,
for the word fails to express something which must clearly be
supra-intellectual&mdash;the perception of a conscious state of emotion.</p>

<p>Of what then was the Earth a symbol to Whitman&rsquo;s
sight? He says, frankly enough,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> that he cannot convey
the idea in print; but that as far as he can suggest it,
it is one of progress, or amelioration; it is generous,
calm, subtle; it includes the idea of expression, or the
bearing of fruit; it is the acceptance of all things, and
it is the general purpose which underlies them all.</p>

<p>I fear that those who seek for simple explanations in
plain words will scarcely be satisfied with this. Perhaps
Whitman is only reasserting in his own manner the
familiar adage that God is the prince of poets, and that
the universe is His Chapbook which He offers to all. If
so, he either gives a new meaning to the words, or he
has rediscovered their old vital sense and redeemed them
from the stigma of rhetoric. I do not know whether
after all the simple-sounding words are not the more
elusive.</p>

<p>The Words of the Earth-Mother spoken to her children
are, he would have us believe, ultimate and infallible;
all things may be tried by them. That is what he
means when he says he has read his poems over in the
open air. He has proved them thus to see if their suggestion
is that of the Earth. She sits, as it were, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
her back turned toward her children,<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> but in her hand
she holds a mirror, the clear mirror of appearances
which are true, and in that mirror we may see ourselves
and her.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">With her ample back toward every beholder,</div>
<div class="verse">With the fascinations of youth, and equal fascinations of age,</div>
<div class="verse">Sits she whom I too love like the rest&mdash;sits undisturb&rsquo;d,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her eyes glance back from it,</div>
<div class="verse">Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How much we can see, depends upon our own
character. To the perfect man, the Face of the
Mother is perfect: to the man ashamed, disfigured,
broken, it appears to be such as he. Only the pure
behold the Truth. There is no merely intellectual test
of truth, for truth is known only by the Soul. As one
looks into the mirror, and reads the thought behind
appearances, not with the intellect but with the sight
of the awakened soul, one grows to understand what
Progress means, one sees a little further into the secrets
of Love; one learns that the divine Love neither invites
nor refuses.</p>

<p>The Sayers of Words are those who with pure insight&mdash;or
as Coleridge would say, Imagination&mdash;behold things
as they are apprehended by the cosmic consciousness; and
thus beholding them as they truly are, find words which
hint to the soul of that Reality which speaks through
all appearance. After the sayers come the singers, the
Poets who, building words together, create new worlds.</p>

<p>In another poem, the Open Road<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> becomes the symbol
of Freedom, Acceptance, Sanity, Comradeship, Immortality
and Eternal Battles.</p>

<p>Among the best known and most popular of the <i>Leaves
of Grass</i>, it is also among those which are most filled
with recondite and mystic meanings. Over these we
must not linger, save to note the indication of the mystic
sense by phrases like &ldquo;the float of the sight of things&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the efflux of the Soul&rdquo;. The poem as a whole is
marked by musical cadences, and is vivid from end to
end with courage and the open air.</p>

<p>After the &ldquo;Song of Myself,&rdquo; Thoreau preferred the
&ldquo;Sun-down Poem,&rdquo; which describes the crossing of
Brooklyn Ferry.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> It is filled with the thought that, even
after half a century and in our own day, when others than
he will be crossing, still he will be with them there unseen.
The thoughts that come to him show him the Soul
wrapt around in unconsciousness, and the things which,
by contact with the clean senses, are presently realised
as meanings by the Soul. The poem is a fine example
of Whitman&rsquo;s delight in movement, in masses of people,
and in the surroundings of his city.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Clef-poem,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> intended to strike the key-note,
not only for his poems, but as it were for the universe
itself with its innumerable meanings, he tells how, standing
on the beach at night alone, he realised that all things&mdash;soul
and body, past and future, here and there&mdash;are
interlocked and spanned by a vast homogeneity of essence.
The knowledge sweeps away all possibilities of anxiety
about the future after death; experience can never fail
to feed the soul. It contents him also with the present:
no experience can ever be more wonderful to him than
this of to-night, when he lies upon the breast of the
Mother of his being. The future can be nothing but an
eternal unfolding of this that he beholds already present
in his body and Soul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While dwelling upon the symbolical mysticism which
cannot be ignored in Whitman&rsquo;s whole habit of thought,
I may add a further word upon its character.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Mysticism
appears under several forms. The Indian guru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
winning the eternal consciousness by long practices in
the gymnasium of the mind; the lover discovering it
through the fiery gateways, and tear-washed windows
of passion; the poet seeking it in the eyes of the Beauty
that was before the beginning of the world; the Quaker
awaiting its coming in silence and simplicity; the Catholic
preparing for it by prayer and fasting, by ritual and
ceremony; the lover of nature discovering it among her
solitudes; the lover of man entering into it only by faith,
in the strenuous service of his kind: all these bear witness
to the many ways of experience along which the
deep waters flow.</p>

<p>Belonging to no school, Whitman had relations with
several of the mystical groups; he had least, I suppose,
with that which seeks the occult by traditional crystal-gazing
and the media of hypnotic trances or the dreams
produced by anæsthetic drugs. He was a mystic because
wonders beset him all about on the open road of his
soul. In him mysticism was never associated with
pathological symptoms; it was, as he himself suggests,
the flower and proof of his sanity, soundness and health.</p>

<p>He had not learnt his lore from books. Plato and
Plotinus, Buddha and Boehme, were alike but half-familiar
to him; he never studied them closely as a disciple
should. His thought may have been quickened
by old Elias Hicks, and strengthened occasionally by contact
with the Friends. It often recalls the more leonine,
less catholic spirit of George Fox; and the vision of the
Soul, standing like an unseen companion by the side of
every man, woman, and child, ready to appear at the first
clear call of deep to human deep, was ever present to
them both, and in itself explains much that must otherwise
remain incomprehensible in their attitude. But the
world of Whitman was that of the nineteenth century,
not of the seventeenth: Carlyle, Goethe and Lincoln,
had taken the places of Calvin, Milton and Cromwell.
In many aspects the mysticism of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is
nearer to that of <i>The Republic</i> and <i>The Symposium</i>, than to
that of Fox&rsquo;s <i>Epistles</i> and <i>Journal</i>; nearer, that is, to the
Greek synthesis, than to the evangelical ardour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
Puritan. Temperance he loved, but he hated the
narrowness of negations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To return to the book: the thought of the sanity of
the Earth is brought to bear upon the problem of evil in
a poem<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> which describes how, in spite of the mass of
corruption returned to it by disease and death, the earth
neutralises all by the chemistry of its laws and life.
With calm and patient acceptance of evil, nature refuses
nothing, but ever provides man anew with innocent and
divine materials. And such, it would seem, is the inherent
character of the Universe, and therefore of the Soul.</p>

<p>A poem,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> whose opening cadences were suggested by
the drip, drip, drip, of the rain from the eaves, presents
the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Broadaxe">Broad-axe</span> as the true emblem of America, Whitman&rsquo;s
substitute for the Eagle whose wings are always
spread.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Broad-axe, shapely, naked, wan!</div>
<div class="verse">Head from the mother&rsquo;s bowels drawn!</div>
<div class="verse">Wooded flesh and metal bone! limb only one and lip only one!</div>
<div class="verse">Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve produced from a little seed sown!</div>
<div class="verse">Resting the grass amid and upon,</div>
<div class="verse">To be leaned, and to lean on.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here we enter the picturesque, muscular world of
wood-cutters and carpenters so familiar to the author,
and we are reminded of the older and more sinister uses
and products of the axe. Seen by Whitman, the Broad-axe
itself is a poem that tells of strenuous America, with
her free heroic life and the comradeship of her Western
cities, great with the greatness of their common folk.
It tells him of the woman of America, self-possessed and
strong; and of large, natural, naïve types of manhood.
It even prophecies to him of Walt Whitman, and sings
the &ldquo;Song of Myself,&rdquo; the message of the noble fierce undying
Self. As a Cuvier can reconstruct an undiscovered
creature from a single fossil bone, so might the poet seer
have foretold America by this symbol of an axe.</p>

<p>The idea of America is further expounded in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
other poems, especially in the longest of the additions,
which was afterwards expanded into &ldquo;By Blue Ontario&rsquo;s
Shore&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Much of its essential thought, however, and
some of its actual phrasing belongs to the old Preface,
and has therefore been already noted. It dwells on the
potential equality of every citizen in the sight of America
herself, an equality based upon the divine Soul which is
in each; and also, upon Liberty, which is the ultimate
and essential element of all individual life.</p>

<p>The thought of America calls up in Whitman&rsquo;s mind
the picture of that poet, that &ldquo;Soul of Love and tongue
of fire,&rdquo; who will utter the idea which is America, and
which alone can integrate her diverse peoples into one.
And here Whitman flings off his cloak which concealed
him in the Preface, and openly announces that it is he
himself who incarnates the spirit of the land.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Fall behind me, States!</div>
<div class="verse">A man, before all&mdash;myself, typical, before all.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>The poet is that equable sane man, in whose vision
alone all things find and are seen in their proper place,
for he sees each <i>sub specie æternitatis</i>&mdash;in its eternal
aspect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>But while thus boldly declaring himself as the man
that should come, he has of course no desire to stand
alone, and attempts to outline the equipment necessary
for future American poets. They must not only identify
themselves in every possible way with America, they
must be themselves creative and virile. Those who
criticise, explain and adjudge, can only create a literary
soil; they cannot produce the flower and fruit of
poetry.</p>

<p>Returning to his favourite adage that a man is as
great as a nation, he asserts that the true poet is
America; frankly reading himself as a whole, he will
see the meanings of America. Is then America also a
symbol? Assuredly. She is the Republic; she is the
Kingdom of God; she is Blake&rsquo;s Jerusalem; but behold,
she is already founded and four-square upon the solid
earth.</p>

<p>That he was open-eyed to the materialistic spirit rampant
throughout the continent while he was writing,
is clearly shown in the bitter mockery of &ldquo;Respondez,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
a poem afterwards suppressed. It is a challenge to
thought; an ironic assertion of things that are false and
futile, and which yet parade as realities. Though suggestive
it is obscure, and its subsequent omission was
wise.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the destiny of America,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and of the evil
and imperfection which he saw about him, hindering, as
it seemed, the realisation of that destiny, and of the
destiny of individual souls, must often have moved him
to passionate longing. He was not one of those who
confuse good with evil; he always recognised the difference
between right and wrong as among the eternal
distinctions which could never cease to hold true. He
hated sin as he hated disease, and recognised both as
threatening and actual.</p>

<p>If he rarely denounces, it is because he has seen that
the way of the soul is along the path of love and not of
fear or of hate; and because he recognises the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
sin in the story of the soul. He is not anxious about
vice or virtue, but only about life and love. Love, at its
fullest, is something different from virtue; it contains
elements which virtue can never possess, and which
most ethical codes consign to the category of vice.
Such love alone is the expression of the soul; and every
student of love discovers sooner or later that the soul
has its own intimate standard for judging what is wrong
and what is right, and when that which was wrong has
now become right for it to do.</p>

<p>Love, then, is Whitman&rsquo;s code. And when he seeks
to call the youth of America away from selfishness and
sin, he issues no new table of Thou-Shalt-Nots, but fills
their ears with the words of their destiny, and of the
meaning of America. For he knows that to sin is to
choose a narrow and despicable delight, and that one
must needs choose the nobler, larger joy when it becomes
present and real. Hence he recalls all the aspirations
that went to the birth of America, and describes the
parts that women and men must fill if they are to be
realised. He reminds his young readers of all the divine
possibilities of manhood and of womanhood, and of how
those possibilities are for them; and warns them that
the body must necessarily affect the soul, for it is the
medium through which the soul comes into consciousness.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Finally, in the new poems, Whitman makes more
plain his attitude toward the woman question, as it is
called. An American National Women&rsquo;s Rights Asso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>ciation
had been founded in 1850, and although its
agitation for the suffrage proved unsuccessful, the more
general movement which it represented, especially the
higher education of women, was gaining ground throughout
America. The movement may be said to have been
born in New York State, where Mrs. Elizabeth Cady
Stanton and Miss Susan B. Anthony were its most
active leaders; but it owed much to Boston also, and
notably to Margaret Fuller (Ossoli), whose tragic death
had been an irreparable loss to the cause.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Whitman was in cordial sympathy with everything
that could forward the independence of women. But
he disliked some outstanding characteristics of the movement.
It was in part a violent reaction against the
unwholesome sentimentalism of the past; a reaction
which took the form of sexless intellectualism with a
strong bent towards argumentation, perhaps the most
abhorrent of all qualities to Whitman.</p>

<p>This movement for women&rsquo;s rights seemed to him
too academic and too superficial; college education and
the suffrage did not appeal to him. But he was not
the less an enthusiast for the cause itself, as he understood
it. His views are simple and clear. A soul is a
soul, whether it be man&rsquo;s or woman&rsquo;s; and as such, it is
of necessity free, and the equal of others. A woman
is every way as good as a man. This truth must be
made effective in all departments of life.</p>

<p>Then, taking up the thought which underlies the
teaching of Plato, a woman is a citizen; and an American
woman must be as independent, as dauntless, as
greatly daring as a man. Such as the woman essentially
is, such will be the man, her son, and her mate. But&mdash;and
it is here he differs from the leaders of the movement&mdash;sex
is basic not only in society but in personal
life; and the woman unsexed is but half a woman.</p>

<p>Two poems in the new edition, the nucleus of the
subsequent <i>Children of Adam</i>, are devoted to these ideas.
In the first,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> he describes the women of his ideal:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They are not one jot less than I am,</div>
<div class="verse">They are tanned in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,</div>
<div class="verse">Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,</div>
<div class="verse">They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,</div>
<div class="verse">They are ultimate in their own right&mdash;they are calm, clear, well-possessed of themselves.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the second,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> he declares that life is only life after love&mdash;he
means the passionate fulness of love&mdash;and indicates
that womanhood is to be glorified not through a sexless
revolt, but through the redemption of paternity. When
the begetting of children is recognised to be as holy
and as noble as the bearing of them, then the rights of
women will be on the way to recognition.</p>

<p>If motherhood is the glory of the race, then a movement
towards perpetual virginity brings no solution of
our problem. The only solution lies in the independence
of women, and in the evolution of a higher masculine
ideal of the sex relation. The whole thing must be
naturally and honestly faced. Until we so face it, we
cannot understand a world in which it is so implicated,
that sex is, as it were, a summing up of all things.</p>

<p>This last thought grew upon him, becoming more
prominent in the next edition. In the present one it
recurs in the open letter to Emerson printed in its
appendix,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and gave a peculiar colour to the volume in
the public eye. So much was this the case, that a
prosecution seemed at one time imminent, many persons
regarding the book as obscene. Among timid and conventional
people, it seems to be established as a canon
of criticism that it is always immoral to discuss immorality.
They go but little farther who denounce the
purity which is not defiled by pitch; or tear out by the
roots all flowers that grow upon dung-heaps.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such then, added to the old, formed the contents
of the new edition of 1856. The appendix included
Emerson&rsquo;s letter, which Whitman had been urged to
publish, by Mr. C. A. Dana, editor of the <i>New York Sun</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
and a personal friend of Emerson.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> He succeeded in
convincing Whitman, who appears at first to have
doubted the propriety of such an action. There is no
evidence that Emerson resented the use thus made of
his glowing testimony, although he would probably
have modified his words had he written in acknowledgment
of the enlarged volume. A sentence from the
letter appeared also upon the back of the book: &ldquo;I greet
you at the commencement of a great career.&mdash;R. W.
Emerson.&rdquo; This, together with the storm of indignation
aroused by the absolutely frank language of the
poems dealing with sex, gave the book notoriety and a
rapid sale.</p>

<p>It is the least pleasing of the editions of <i>Leaves of
Grass</i>, insignificant in appearance, and yet aggressive,
by reason of that Emersonian testimonial. The open
letter at the end, of which I have already spoken, is far
from agreeable to read. It is careless, egotistical, naïve
to a degree, and crowded with exaggerations. Addressing
Emerson as master, it proceeds to denounce the
churches as one vast lie, and the actual president as a
rascal and a thief. It is so egregiously self-conscious
that it makes the reader question for a moment whether
all the egoism and naïveté of the preceding pages
may not have been worn as a pose; but a moment&rsquo;s
further consideration gives the question a final negative.
Few men are without their hours of weakness; and
that Whitman was not among those few, the letter is
proof if such were needed.</p>

<p>The letter is not void of interest, since it records the
rapid sale of the previous edition of a thousand copies,
and anticipates that in a few more years the annual
issue will be counted by thousands. This sanguine
forecast explains the permanent and otherwise unreasonable
disappointment of Whitman at the reception of his
book.</p>

<p>It still made its appearance devoid of the usual
adornment of a publisher&rsquo;s name upon the title-page.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
Messrs. Fowler &amp; Wells were again the principal agents,
others being arranged with in the chief American cities,
in London also, and Paris and Brussels. Plates were
cast from the type, and a large sale was prepared for.
But the New York agents soon withdrew, unwilling to
face the storm of public opinion,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and perhaps the
dangers of prosecution, and the book fell out of print
when only a thousand copies had been issued.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two ventures of 1855 and 1856 had brought Whitman
little money, a mere handful of serious readers, and
some notoriety. Though he did not give in, he began
to look about him for some supplementary means of
delivering his soul of its burden. His youthful success
on the political platform, his love of crowds and of
personal contact, his extraordinary popularity among
the younger people, and his own keen sense of the
power of oratory, turned his thoughts to lecturing.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
He would follow the road which Emerson and Thoreau
had taken. He would evangelise America with his
gospel. Henceforward, as his mother said, he wrote
barrels of lectures,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and at the same time he studied his
new art more or less systematically. After his death a
package of notes on Oratory, and the rough draft of a
prospectus were found among his papers; the latter was
headed, &ldquo;15 cents. Walt Whitman&rsquo;s Lectures.&rdquo; It
belongs to the year 1858.</p>

<p>By this time he had planned to write, print, distribute
and recite throughout the United States and Canada a
number of lectures&mdash;partly philosophical, partly socio-political,
partly religious&mdash;with the object of creating
what he conceived to be a new, and for the first time
truly American attitude of mind. The lectures were
ultimately to form a second volume of explanation and
argument which would sustain the <i>Leaves</i>. He had now
omitted any preface to the poems, the creative work
standing alone. But having printed the second edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
and thus relieved his mind of its most pressing burden,
he recognised that the work of explanation and of
criticism remained.</p>

<p>Moreover, he conceived that his lectures would
quicken public interest in his book; while, by showing
himself, he hoped to dispel some of the misapprehensions
which concealed his real meaning from the
popular mind. He alludes whimsically in this memorandum
to the offensive practice of self-advertisement,
of which he was not unconscious, remarking that &ldquo;it
cannot be helped,&rdquo; for it is the only way by which he
can gain the ear of America, and bid her &ldquo;Know thyself&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Finally, he proposed to earn his living in this manner.
He would have preferred to give his services without
fee, in the Quaker fashion; but for the time being at
least, he must make a charge of ten dollars (two
guineas) a lecture, and expenses, or an admission fee of
one dime (about sixpence) a head.</p>

<p>The idea of lecturing was probably as old as the idea
of the <i>Leaves of Grass</i>; he seems to have been considering
it ever since he returned from the South. But now
he formulated his ideas, which were of course those
underlying the <i>Leaves</i>, and thought much and cogently
on the style and manner of public speaking. His conclusions
betray an ideal for oratory as individual and as
mystical as that for the poet&rsquo;s art.</p>

<p>Whitman, the lecturer, is conceived as a prophet
possessed by the tempestuous passion of inspiration.
The orator is to combine the gifts of the great actor
with the inspiration of the Pythoness and the spontaneity
of the Quaker prophet. His gestures should be
large, but reserved; the delivery deliberate, thought-awakening,
elliptical, prophetic, wholly unlike that of
the glib platform speakers of his day and our own.
At first, erect and motionless, the speaker would impress
his mere personality upon the assembly; then his
eyes would kindle, like the eyes in that strange marble
Balzac of Rodin&rsquo;s, and from the eyes outward the
whole body would take fire and speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>He conceived of oratory not as the delivery of some
well-prepared address, but as the focussing of all the
powers of thought and experience in an hour of inspiration
and supreme mastery. He saw how much it
entailed&mdash;what breadth of knowledge, what depth of
thought, what perfect flexibility of voice and gesture
trained to clear suggestion, what absolute purity of
body, what perfect self-control. For, he would say to
himself, the great orator is an artist as supreme as
Alboni herself; his voice is to be as potent as hers,
and his life must show an equal devotion to its purpose.</p>

<p>In this conception of the orator we have then a most
interesting parallel with that of the poet. And just as
Whitman the poet stands part way between the writer
of prose and the singer in verse, including in himself
some of the qualities of each, and adding an inspiration
wholly his own, so Whitman the orator appears in this
vision standing between the actor-singer and the lecturer
or preacher, improvising great words.</p>

<p>The political aspect of his enterprise is suggested by
a brief memorandum, dated in April, 1857,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> wherein he
notes that the &ldquo;Champion of America&rdquo; must keep himself
clear of all official entanglements, devoting himself
solely to the maintenance of a living interest in public
questions throughout the length and breadth of the land.
Standing aside from the parties with their clamorous
cries, he must hold the public ear by nobler tones.</p>

<p>In another place<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> he writes that as Washington had
freed the body politic of America from its dependence
upon the English crown, so Whitman will free the
American people from their dependence upon European
ideals. The mere publication of such frank, but private
assertions of Whitman&rsquo;s own faith in himself, will doubtless
arouse a ready incredulity in the reader&rsquo;s mind. It
might, perhaps, seem kinder to his memory to suppress
them altogether; but upon second thought it will, I
think, appear possible that he was a better judge than
others of his own ability. His personality was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
extraordinary power, and his outlook of a breadth which
was almost unique. And, as I have said, he felt himself
to be an incarnation of the American spirit.</p>

<p>At the time, America was without leadership. Lincoln
was still unseen; and Whitman was fully as capable of
filling the highest office in the United States as several
who have held it; while nothing in the circumstances
or traditions of the White House made it absurd for
any able citizen, of whatever rank, to entertain the
thought of its tenancy. This would be especially true
of a popular New Yorker, who made perhaps the best
of all candidates for a Presidential campaign. The
Republican party had but just been formed, and for
the first time had fought an election. Thunderclouds
of war were in the air, urged on by the ominous forces
of slavery, and America was without a champion.</p>

<p>I think the idea of political leadership crossed Whitman&rsquo;s
mind at this time, and that he put it definitely
aside. The hour cried out for the man, and the cry was
not to go unanswered; but with all his power and all
his goodwill and fervour, Whitman became slowly convinced
that it was not to be he. He had seen too much
of party man&oelig;uvres, and had too vigorous a love of
personal liberty, to contend for office. But he did covet
the power of a prophet to stir the heart of America, and
appeal to her people everywhere in her name. He
never gave up the idea of lecturing or lost his interest
in oratory; but the lectures he planned, the course on
Democracy and the rest, remained undelivered. It is
as though he had prepared himself and stood awaiting
a call which never came.</p>

<p>Instead, he turned once more to add new poems to
his collection. A hint in explanation is to be found in
a poem written about this time,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in which he tells how,
having first sought knowledge, he then determined to
live for America and become her orator; he was afterwards
possessed by the desire for a heroic life of action,
but was given the commission of song. Finally, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
change came over his spirit; the claims of his own life
seized him; he could not escape from the passion of comradeship
which overwhelmed him and wholly absorbed
his thought.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> We shall consider this phase in the next
chapter, but before doing so, it will be well to recall the
political events of the hour and the circumstances surrounding
the advent of a new power and personality into
American life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;YEAR OF METEORS&rdquo;</p>


<p class="p2">Abraham Lincoln, the man for whom the
hour cried out, was not quite unknown to fame.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
Ten years older than Whitman, and like Whitman
owning to a strain of Quaker blood in his veins, he
belonged by origin to the South and by adoption to the
West. After six years&rsquo; service in the Illinois Legislature,
and a term in the Lower House at Washington,
he settled down at the age of forty to his profession as
a country lawyer.</p>

<p>In 1854 the repeal of the Missouri compromise in
favour of &ldquo;squatter sovereignty&rdquo; recalled him to political
life, and he became the champion of Free-soil
principles in his State, against the chief sponsor of the
opposing doctrine, the &ldquo;little giant of Illinois,&rdquo; Judge
Stephen Douglas. His reply to Douglas in October of
that year was read and applauded by his party throughout
America.</p>

<p>Hitherto he had been a Whig, and during Clay&rsquo;s lifetime,
his devoted follower, but the repeal of the compromise
was followed in 1856 by the formation of a new
party, and Lincoln and Whitman both became &ldquo;black
republicans&rdquo;. &ldquo;Barnburners,&rdquo; Abolitionists and &ldquo;Anti-Nebraska&rdquo;
men&mdash;those that is to say who opposed the
application of the doctrine of &ldquo;squatter sovereignty&rdquo; to
Nebraska and Kansas&mdash;had united to form a new Free-soil
party. They nominated J. C. Frémont, the gallant
Californian &ldquo;Path-finder&rdquo; for the Presidency; but,
owing to the presence of a third candidate put forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
by the Know-nothing Whigs&mdash;whose only policy seems
to have been a &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; hatred of all Catholics and
foreigners&mdash;the Democratic nominee was elected for the
last time in a generation. After his four years were
out, a succession of Republican Presidents occupied
the White House for twenty-four years.</p>

<p>James Buchanan, who defeated Frémont&mdash;becoming
like Lincoln, his successor, a minority President&mdash;seems
to have been an honourable and well-intentioned Pennsylvanian,
but he was a man whose character was quite
insufficient for his new office. As an injudicious, short-sighted
diplomatist, he had already, when minister at
St. James&rsquo;s in the days of President Pierce, commended
his intrigues for the annexation of Cuba.</p>

<p>Earlier in 1856 Chief Justice Taney, of the Supreme
Court, had delivered his notorious decision in the Dred
Scott case; laying it down that Congress could not forbid
a citizen to carry his property into the public domain&mdash;that
is to say, it could not prohibit slavery in the
territories&mdash;and that, in the political sense of the word,
a negro was not a &ldquo;man,&rdquo; but only property. This
decision and the bloody scenes enacted in Kansas, where
settlers from the North and South were met to struggle
for the constitution which should make the new State
either slave or free, greatly exasperated public opinion,
and called forth, among others, the protests of Abraham
Lincoln.</p>

<p>In 1858, while Whitman was studying oratory, Lincoln
was stumping Illinois, in those ever-memorable
debates which laid bare all the plots and purposes of
the Southern politicians. When the votes in that contest
were counted, Lincoln held an actual majority; but
Douglas was returned as Senator by a majority of the
electoral votes. Though thus defeated, Lincoln was no
longer hidden in a Western obscurity. He was a man
with a future; and America had half-unconsciously
recognised him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Towards the close of 1859, the fire which had been
kindled in Kansas flashed out suddenly in Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
America was startled by the news of John Brown&rsquo;s raid,
and the capture of the arsenal at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>

<p>Brown was among the most remarkable personalities
of the time; and while some saw in him a religious
fanatic of the Roundhead type, who compelled his
enemies to pray at the muzzle of his musket, and who
for the Abolition cause would shatter the Union; others
counted him a martyr for the cause of freedom. Emerson
had been one of his most earnest backers when first
he went to Kansas; and now his deed fired the enthusiasm
of New England. Thoreau wrote: &ldquo;No man in
America has ever stood up so persistently and effectively
for the dignity of human nature, knowing himself for a
man, and the equal of any Government&rdquo;; and when he
was hung, it was Thoreau who vehemently declared
that John Brown seemed to him to be the only man in
America who had not died.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> His high spirit quickened
the conscience of the North, and two years later its sons
marched into Virginia singing the song of his apotheosis.</p>

<p>Whitman was present at the trial of certain of Brown&rsquo;s
abettors in the State House at Boston;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> one of a group
prepared to effect their rescue in the event of a miscarriage
of justice. Lincoln, on the other hand, was of
those who, in spite of their intense hatred of slavery,
wholly disapproved the Raid. For him, John Brown
was a maddened enthusiast, a mere assassin like Orsini.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
His attempt to raise the slaves of Virginia in revolt
against the whites was abhorrent to the Republican
statesman whose knowledge of the South showed him
the horrors of a negro rising. Regarding slavery as
the irreconcilable and only dangerous foe of the Republic,
Lincoln held that the Federal Government must
restrain it within its actual bounds; and that the sentiment
in favour of gradual emancipation advocated by
Jefferson, the father of the Democratic party, should
be encouraged in the States of the South. But it was
the States themselves that held and must hold the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span>
right of choice; it was for them, not for America, to
liberate their slaves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the figure of Lincoln was thus becoming more
and more visible to the nation, Whitman was fulfilling
his own destiny in New York. He was born to be a
leader of men; but a poet, a path-finder, a pioneer, not
a politician or president. Whatever his noble ambition
might urge, or his quick imagination prompt, he kept
his feet to the path of his proper destiny.</p>

<p>He had a prodigiously wide circle of friends, gathered
from every walk of life: journalists and literary men of
all kinds; actors and actresses; doctors and an occasional
minister of religion; political and public characters;
the stage-drivers and the hands on the river-boats;
farmers from the country; pilots and captains of the
port; labourers, mechanics and artisans of every trade;
loungers too, and many a member of that class which
society has failed to assimilate and which it hunts from
prison to asylum and poor-house; and he had acquaintances
among another class of outcasts whose
numbers were already an open menace to the life of
the Western metropolis, the girls who sell themselves
upon the streets.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>Many anecdotes are told of him during these years:
how for instance he would steer the ferry-boats, till
once he brought his vessel into imminent peril, and
never thereafter would consent to handle the wheel; or
how, during the illness of a comrade, he held his post,
driving his stage in the winter weather while he lay
in the wards of the hospital; or again, how he took
Emerson to a favourite rendezvous of firemen and
teamsters, his good friends, and to the astonishment of
the kindly sage, proved himself manifestly one of them.</p>

<p>A doctor at the old New York Hospital,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> a dark stone
building surmounted by a cupola, and looking out over
a grassy square through iron gates upon Pearl Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
often met him in the wards, where he came to visit one
or other of his driver friends, and enjoyed the restful
influence of his presence there or in the little house-doctor&rsquo;s
room. In those days, when Broadway was
crammed with vehicles and with stages of all colours,
much as is the Strand to-day, the proverbial American
daring and recklessness gave ample opportunity for
accidents. As to the drivers, they were generally
country-bred farmers&rsquo; sons, fine fellows, wide-awake
and thoroughly conversant with all that passed in the
city from the earliest grey of dawn till midnight: and
Whitman found some of his closest comrades in their
ranks.</p>

<p>Sometimes a member of the hospital staff would go
over with him to Pfaff&rsquo;s German restaurant or Rathskeller
on Broadway; a large dingy basement to which
one descended from the street. Here, half under the
pavement, were the tables, bar and oyster stall, whereat
the Bohemians of New York were wont to gather, and
in a yellow fog of tobacco-smoke denounce all things
Bostonian. John Swinton, a friend of Alcott and of
Whitman, belonged to the group,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and among those
who drank Herr Pfaff&rsquo;s lager-beer, and demolished his
schwartz brod, Swiss cheese, and Frankfurter wurst,
were many of the brilliant little band which at this time
was making the <i>New York Saturday Press</i> a challenge to
everything academic and respectable.</p>

<p>It was here that a young Bostonian, paying his first
visit to the city in 1860,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> found Whitman installed at the
head of a long table, already a hero in that revolutionary
young world. The <i>Press</i> was his champion, and his
voice was not to be silenced. Mr. Howells, for it was
he, had been amused and amazed at the ferociously
profane Bohemianism of the worthy editor, who had
lived in Paris, and now worshipped it in the person of
Victor Hugo as much as he detested Longfellow and
Boston.</p>

<p>Mr. Howells was astonished and deeply impressed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
the extraordinary charm, gentleness and benignity of
the man whom the <i>Press</i> was extolling as arch-anarch
and rebel. Whitman&rsquo;s eyes and voice made a frank
and irresistible proffer of friendship, and he gave you
his hand as though it were yours to keep. An atmosphere
of unmistakable purity emanated from him in
the midst of that thickness of smoke, that reek of beer
and oysters and German cooking. He was clean as
the sea is clean. He passed along the ordinary levels
of life as one who lives among the mountains, and
finds his home on Helicon or Olympus.</p>

<p>Ada Clare<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> (Mrs. Julia Macelhinney), by all accounts
a charming and brilliant woman, was queen of this
rebel circle, and especially a friend of Whitman&rsquo;s.
News of her tragic death from hydrophobia, caused by
the bite of her pet dog, came as a terrible shock to all
who had known her. He had other women friends,
notably Mrs. &ldquo;Abby&rdquo; Price, of Brooklyn, and her two
daughters.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The mother was an incurable lover of her
kind, whose hospitality to the outcast survived all the
frauds practised upon it.</p>

<p>The haunted faces of the needy were becoming only
too familiar both in New York and Brooklyn. The
winter of 1857-58 had been a black one:<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> banks had
broken, and work had come to a standstill; and there
had been in consequence the direst need among the
ever-increasing class of men who were wholly dependent
upon their weekly earnings. The rise of this class in a
new country marks the advent of the social problem in
its more acute form: and from this date on there was
a rapid development of the usual palliative agencies,
missions, rescue-homes and what-not. The permanent
problem of poverty had made its appearance in America.</p>

<p>It need hardly be added that at the same time there
were many evidences of the growing wealth of another
class of the citizens, those whose profits were derived from
land-values and the employment of wage-labour. The
brown-stone characteristic of the modern city was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
replacing the wood and brick which had hitherto lined
Broadway,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> as private houses gave way to shops and
offices, hotels and theatres. Residences were built
farther and farther up-town; and the Quarantine
Station on Staten Island, which stood in the way of a
similar expansion in that desirable quarter, was burnt
out by aspiring citizens. And meanwhile the pressure
of life in the East-side rookeries was growing more and
more tyrannous.</p>

<p>The foundering of a slave-ship off Montauk Point
was one of the more striking reminders of the menace
of vested interests to all that the fathers of the Republic
had held dear.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> For even the slave trade was now
being revived, and the hands of Northern merchants
were anything but clean from the gold of conspiracy.
Sympathy for the &ldquo;institution&rdquo; and its corollaries was
strong in New York, and was not unrepresented at
Pfaff&rsquo;s. It must have been about the close of 1861,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> or
a little later, that one of the Bohemians proposed a toast
to the success of the Southern arms. Whitman retorted
with indignant and passionate words: an altercation
ensued across the table, with some show of ill-mannered
violence by the Southern enthusiast; and Whitman left
his old haunt, never to return till the great storm of the
war had become a far-away echo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">
<img src="images/i140.jpg" width="469" height="800" alt="Picture of Walt at forty." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN AT FORTY</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are two portraits which belong to the Pfaffian
days. In either he might be the stage-driver of Broadway,
and his dress presents a striking contrast with the
stiff gentility of the orthodox costume, the silk hat and
broadcloth, of the correct citizen. He is a great nonchalant
fellow, with rough clothes fit for manual toil; a
coat whose collar, by the way, has a rebellious upward
turn; a waistcoat, all unbuttoned save at a point about
half-way down, exposing the loose-collared shirt surrounded
by a big knotted tie. The trousers are of the
same striped stuff as the vest; one hand is thrust into
a pocket, the other holds his broad brim.</p>

<p>In the photograph, which alone is of full length, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
face is strong and kindly, as Mr. Howells saw it; but
in the painting, which dates from 1859,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and is valuable
as showing the florid colouring of the man at this time&mdash;the
growth of hair and beard, though touched with
grey, very vigorous and still dark, the eyebrows almost
black, the face handsome, red and full as of an old-time
sea-captain&mdash;the aspect is heavy and even a little sinister.
Probably this is a clumsy rendering of that lethargic and
brooding condition which the occupation of sitting for a
portrait would be likely to induce; and in this it is
curiously unlike that of the photograph.</p>

<p>The pose in the latter is unstudied and a little
awkward; one cannot help feeling that the man ought
to loaf a little less. The head is magnificent, but the
knees are loose. There was something in Whitman&rsquo;s
character which this full-length portrait indicates better
than any other; something indefinite and complacent,
which matched with his deliberate and swaggery gait.
It is a quality which exasperates the formalists, and all
the people who feel positively indecent in anything but
a starched shirt.</p>

<p>Whitman wore the garb and fell naturally into the
attitudes of the manual worker. When he was not at
work he was relaxed, and stood at ease in a way that no
one could mistake. And when he went out to enjoy
himself he never donned a tail-coat and patent shoes.
Something in this very capacity for relaxation and
looseness at the knees made him more companionable
to the average man, as it made him more exasperating
to the superior person. The gentility of the clerical
mannikin of the office was utterly abominable to him;
so much one can read in the portrait, and in the fact that
he persisted in calling himself Walt, the name which
was familiar to the men on the ferry and the road.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early in 1860 Whitman made arrangements with a
firm of young and enterprising Boston publishers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
the issue of a third edition of his book. It had now
been out of print for nearly three years, and new material
had all that time been accumulating, amounting to about
two-thirds of what had already been published.</p>

<p>He went over to Boston and installed himself in
a little room at the printing office, where he spent
his days carefully correcting and revising the proofs.
A friend who found him there speaks of his very
quiet manners.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> He rarely laughed, and never loudly.
He seemed to be provokingly indifferent to the impression
he was creating, and made no effort to talk
brilliantly. He was indeed quite bare of the small
change of conversation, and gave no impression of self-consciousness.
At the time of this interview he was
accompanied by a sickly listless lad whom he had found
at the boarding-house where he stayed. Whitman had
compassion on him and carried him along, in order
that he might communicate something of his own superabundant
vitality to him.</p>

<p>During his stay in Boston, Walt frequently attended
the services then conducted at the Seamen&rsquo;s Bethel by
Father Taylor.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> As a rule, he avoided churches of
every sort, feeling acutely the ineffectiveness of what is
grimly called &ldquo;Divine Service,&rdquo; feeling also that worship
was for the soul in its solitude.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Not that he was
ignorant of that social passion which finds its altar in
communion of spirit, or was blind to the deepest mysteries
of fellowship. To these, as we shall see, he was
particularly sensitive. But the formalities of a church
must have seemed foolish and irksome to one for whom
all fellowship was a kind of worship, and all desire was
a prayer. In the preaching of Father Taylor there was
nothing formal or ineffective. In it Walt felt anew the
passionate sense of reality which had thrilled him as a
child in the preaching of old Elias Hicks.</p>

<p>Father Taylor was now nearly seventy;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> a southerner
by birth, he had been a sailor, and became upon conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>sion
a &ldquo;shouting Methodist&rdquo;. The earnestness of his
first devotion remained with him to the last; and his
prayers were especially marked by the power which
flowed from him continually. Behind the high pulpit
in the quaint heavily-timbered, wood-scented chapel
was painted a ship in distress, in vivid illustration of
his words which were ever returning to the sea. All
his ways were eloquent, unconventional, picturesque
and homely like his face, so that he won the hearts of
all conditions of men, and became one of the idols of
Boston.</p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s power of fascination seemed almost
terrible to his hearers; one young sailor opined that he
must be the actual Holy Ghost. Walt himself was
always moved to tears by the marvellous intimacy of
his passionate pleading in prayer.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> He spoke straight
to the Soul, and not at all, as do common preachers, to
the intelligence or the superficial emotions; and the Soul
of his hearers answered, with the awful promptitude of
an unknown living presence within. His passion of love
was at once tender and remorseless; Whitman compares
him with a surgeon operating upon a beloved patient.</p>

<p>In this man, before whom all the elocution of the
platform was mere trickery, Walt recognised the one
&ldquo;essentially perfect orator&rdquo; whom he had ever heard,
the only one who fulfilled the demands of his own ideal.
And be it remembered, Theodore Parker was in his
power in those days, while Father Taylor was an
evangelical of the old school. It is, after all, not mysticism
but orthodoxy which is exclusive; and though he
was wholly a heretic, Whitman was able fully to love
and appreciate those who were farthest removed from
his own point of view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon this visit Emerson and Whitman saw much
of one another. They were both men in middle life&mdash;Emerson
had passed his fiftieth year&mdash;and each entertained
for the other a feeling of warm and affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
regard. Whitman felt toward the older man almost as
to an elder brother,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and the sweet and wise and kindly
spirit of Emerson frequently sought out the younger
in brotherly solicitude for his welfare.</p>

<p>Their intimacy had sprung from Emerson&rsquo;s letter,
and it was always Emerson who pressed it. Something
in the mental atmosphere in which the Concord
philosopher moved was very repellant to Whitman: he
positively disliked &ldquo;a literary circle,&rdquo; and blamed it for
all the real or imagined shortcomings of his friend. He
himself would not go to Concord from his horror of any
sort of lionizing.</p>

<p>So when Emerson wanted to talk, they would walk together
on the Common;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> as on one memorable, bright,
keen February day, when under the bare branches of
the American elms, they paced to and fro discoursing
earnestly.</p>

<p>Emerson&rsquo;s name had been somewhat too conspicuously
displayed on the back of the second edition, of which he
had been caused to appear almost as a sponsor; and
some of the lines thus introduced had put his Puritan
friends completely out of countenance, while giving his
many enemies an admirable opportunity to blaspheme.
The frank celebration of acts to which modern society
only alludes by indirection, revealed to the observant
eye of orthodoxy that cloven hoof of immorality which
it always suspects concealed about the person of the
philosophic heretic. And we can well imagine the consternation
of the blameless householder of Boston as, in
the bosom of his astonished family, he read aloud the
pages commended to him by the words of the master.</p>

<p>It was thus upon Emerson, who did not quite approve
the offending poems, that much of the storm of indignation
wreaked itself; and whatever Emerson himself
might think of the situation, his family was indignant.
One can almost hear them arguing that a man has
heresies enough of his own to close the ears of men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
his message, without gratuitous implication in heresies
which are not his; if he value his charge, let him keep
clear of other men&rsquo;s eccentricities; he really has no right
to allow himself to be represented as the sponsor for such
sentiments as Whitman printed in the <i>Body Electric</i>.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>But whatever his friends might counsel, Emerson
spoke from his own heart and wisdom that February
day. He was pleading not for himself, but for the truth
as he saw it, and for his offending friend. It was not
because the book was being published as it were in his
own diocese, his own beloved Boston; but because the
new edition would be the first to be issued by a responsible
house, and destined, probably, to enjoy a wide
and permanent circulation, remaining for years the final
utterance of Whitman upon these matters, that Emerson
was so urgent and so eloquent.</p>

<p>His position was a strong one; his arguments, and
the spirit which prompted them, were, as Whitman
admitted, overwhelming, and his companion was in a
sense convinced. It is much to be regretted that neither
of the friends kept any detailed record of this discussion,
but I think we can guess what the older man&rsquo;s position
would be.</p>

<p>Your message of the soul, we can imagine Emerson
saying, is of the utmost importance to America: it is
what America needs, and it is what you, and you alone,
can make her hear. But you can only make her hear
it, if you state it in the most convincing and simple
way.</p>

<p>Now these poems of yours upon sex complicate and
confuse the real message, not because they are necessarily
wrong in themselves&mdash;I do not say they are&mdash;but because
they do and must give rise to misunderstanding, and in
consequence, obscure or even cancel the rest. They give
the book an evil notoriety, and will create for it a <i>succès
de scandale</i>. It will be bought and read by the prurient,
to whom its worth will be wholly sealed.</p>

<p>And not only do you destroy the value of the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
by printing such poems as these, you render it actually
dangerous. Personally you and I are agreed&mdash;he would
say&mdash;with Boehme where he writes that &ldquo;the new spirit
cometh to Divine vision in himself, and heareth God&rsquo;s
word, and hath Divine understanding and inclination ...
and ... <i>the earthly flesh</i> ... <i>hurteth him not at all</i>&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> We
know the flesh to be beautiful and sacred; we turn with
loathing from the blasphemies of Saint Bernard and of
Luther, who saw in it nothing but a maggot-sack, a
sack of dung. On these things we are at one; but how
are we most wisely and surely to direct others on the
road to self-realisation?</p>

<p>To feed the monster of a crude passion is surely not
the way to bring the individual toward the Divine
vision. To be frank about these matters is necessary;
but in order to be honest is it necessary to fling abroad
this wildfire, against which we are all contending, lest
it destroy the labours of ages? Must we nourish this
giant, whose unruly strength is for ever threatening to
tear in pieces the unity of the self?</p>

<p>By these poems you are deliberately consigning your
book to the class which every wise parent must label
&ldquo;dangerous to young people,&rdquo; and which the very spirits
you most desire to kindle for America will be compelled,
by the law of their being, to handle at their peril, and
to turn from with distress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Arguments not unlike these were doubtless used by
Emerson, for we know that he discussed this problem;
and Whitman listened attentively to them, explaining
himself at times, but generally weighing them in silence.
Perhaps they were not new to him, but they were rendered
the more powerful and well-nigh irresistible by
the persuasive and beautiful spirit, the whole magnetic
personality of his friend.</p>

<p>Walt was deeply moved, and when, after a couple of
hours, Emerson concluded the statement of his case
with the challenge, &ldquo;What have you to say to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
things?&rdquo; could but reply, &ldquo;Only that while I can&rsquo;t
answer them at all, I feel more settled than ever to
adhere to my own theory and exemplify it&rdquo;. &ldquo;Very
well,&rdquo; responded Emerson cheerfully, &ldquo;then let us go
to dinner.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>They had been pacing up and down the Long Walk
by Beacon Street, from which one looks across the
broad, park-like stretch of the Common&mdash;that Common
whose grey, bright-eyed squirrels are so confiding, and
whose air is so good from the sea. To-day the oldest
of the elms, that kept record of the past as wisely as
any archives, have yielded to the winds and to the tooth
of time. The growth of these trees is very different
from that of our English species, and their long, curving
branches rib the vault of sky overhead. The two men
went over the historic hill&mdash;where now the gilded dome
of the State House glows richly against the sky&mdash;descending
through picturesquely narrow streets, full
of memories and echoes of old days, to their destination
at the American House.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">THE TESTAMENT OF A COMRADE</p>


<p class="p2">What the theory was from which even Emerson&rsquo;s
eloquence could not persuade Whitman, we
may understand better if we take up the new volume,
turning the pages which were now being added to it,
till toward the end we come upon the matter of debate.</p>

<p>Though handsomer and pleasanter to handle than its
predecessor, this Boston edition still wears a countryman&rsquo;s
dress; a heavily stamped orange cover which
threatens the symmetry of any library shelf. Evidently,
Whitman did not intend it to lie there in peace. It
was to be different from the rest, and bad company for
them.</p>

<p>It opens on a reproduction of the 1859 painting, which
faces an odd-looking lithographed and beflourished title-page.
The old Preface has gone for good, and now its
place is taken by a <i>Proto-Leaf</i> or Summary, by way of
introduction.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>The first edition had been a manifesto of the American
idea in literature and ethics, and a declaration of the
gospel of Self-realisation. The second expanded the
mystical meanings involved in this; &ldquo;think of the soul&rdquo;
running through all, and breaking out continually as
a refrain, and it made clearer the message to women
already more than hinted in the first. Now in the third
edition, emphasis falls upon the personal note, which
becomes strangely haunting. The book is not only
for the first time a complete and living whole; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
a presence, a lover, a comrade, and its close is like a
death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Solitary, singing in the West, says the introductory
Leaf,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> the poet is striking up for a New World; and lo,
he beholds all the peoples of all time as his interminable
audience. For through him, Nature herself speaks without
restraint; and through him, the Soul, the ultimate
Reality.</p>

<p>He sings for America; for there at last the Soul is
acknowledged; and his song will bind her together.
The Body, Sex, Comradeship, these he sings: but above
all, Faith, for he is proclaiming a new religion which
includes all others and is worthy of America.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Of whatever
he may seem to write, he is always writing of
Religion; for indeed she is supreme. Love, Democracy,
Religion&mdash;these three&mdash;and the greatest of these
is Religion.</p>

<p>The world is unseen as much as seen. The air is
full of invisible presences as real as the seen. And his
songs also are for those as yet unseen, his children by
Democracy, the woman of his love. For them he will
reveal the soul, glorious in the body.</p>

<p>Ah, what a glory is this our life, and this our country!
Death itself will not carry him away from it. In these
fields, men and women in the years to come will ever be
discovering him, and he will render them worthy of
America as none other can. For he has &ldquo;arrived,&rdquo; he
is no longer mortal.</p>

<p>If you would behold America, seek her in these pages.
And if you would triumph and make her triumphant,
you must become his comrade. The final note is one of
passionate love-longing for comradeship.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>Such is the summary of the book; but it cannot be
so briefly dismissed by us, for it is full of suggestions of
the inner workings of Whitman&rsquo;s mind at this period,
for us, in some respects, the most characteristic and important
of all. For after it there comes the war, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
watershed of his life; there he employed and in a sense
expended all the resources of his manhood, to issue from
it upon the slopes of ill-health which lead down into the
valley of the shadow. But here he is in his prime, and
on the heights.</p>

<p>Here also, his individuality shows most definitely,
even in its secondary qualities. The association with
men of a somewhat less Bohemian type than were many
of his literary friends in New York, and the more cosmopolitan
atmosphere of the national capital, together
with the close intimacy with death which the war-hospitals
afforded, somewhat quieted the tone of later
editions. Here there is more of the naïve colloquialism
and mannerism, the slang and the ejaculations of &ldquo;the
arrogant Mannhattanese&rdquo; which he loves to proclaim
himself.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It is the edition which is most dear to
many an enthusiast, and most exasperating to many
a critic.</p>

<p>After the first-written and longest of all the poems,
&ldquo;The Song of Myself,&rdquo; here called &ldquo;Walt Whitman,&rdquo;
there follow two large bundles, tied together and labelled
respectively &ldquo;Chants Democratic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leaves of
Grass&rdquo;. The bulk of these consists of material already
familiar.</p>

<p>But number four of the Chants,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> celebrating the organic
unity of America, is new, and may be quoted as a
curious example of Whitman&rsquo;s style. Here are seven
pages of soliloquy practically innocent of a period, flowing
along together in a hardly vertebrate sentence, which
enumerates the different elements included in the Union.
Strange as it certainly looks, this creation must have
been so constructed of set purpose, for Whitman could
not be ignorant of the oddity of its appearance, when
viewed by the ever-alert humour of the already hostile
American critic. Can there possibly be any connection
between this style of composition and the larger consciousness
of which he had experience? The question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
may appear absurd, but I ask it in all seriousness, and
would propose an affirmative answer.</p>

<p>Whitman regarded his whole book as a unit, not as a
collection. Like the composer who elaborates a single
theme into a long-sustained symphony, or the psychological
novelist who requires three volumes for the
portrayal of a personality, he held his meaning suspended
in order that it might be more fully grasped;
and this is true also of his individual poems. The
thought he had to convey was not epigrammatic, but
a complex of suggestions which merge into one as they
are read together. I would even venture to suggest
that some of these exercises in sustained meaning were
also designed to train the faculty of apprehending the
Many-in-One, the Unity, which, as he believed, lies
behind all variety. In considering this suggestion one
may contrast the emotional results produced by epigrams
and long sentences. May not the former be the
natural rhythm for wit and the latter for imagination?</p>

<p>The contrast between the essayist on &ldquo;Man&rdquo; and the
singer of &ldquo;Myself&rdquo; is obvious;<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> but the optimism of the
eighteenth century epigrammatist seems to be echoed in
Whitman&rsquo;s pages.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> On the verge of war, and in the
midst of all the corruption of American politics, he has
the audacity to declare and reiterate, &ldquo;Whatever is, is
best&rdquo;. Are we to dismiss it as the shallow utterance of
a callous-hearted, healthy-bodied, complacent American,
deliberately blind to the world&rsquo;s tragedy? A thousand
times, no. The pages before and after such declarations
are filled with knowledge of suffering and death, of the
bereavement of love, of the shame that follows sin, and
of the desire for a better day. But here and elsewhere,
he sees the perfect plan of the ages being fulfilled.
From his Pisgah-height, he beholds the stretch of
time; and looking out over creation as did the Divine
Eye, he, Walt Whitman, beholds that it is all good.</p>

<p>Emerson has written of &ldquo;the Perfect Whole&rdquo;; but in
the pages before us Whitman specifies the parts, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
them all illumined by the mystic light of the soul. This
lays him open to attack; it is even dangerous from the
point of view of morality. Whitman acknowledges as
much, but he still has faith in his vision; he is still
obedient to the inner impulse which for him at least, is
indubitably divine. There must always be a point at
which the moralist would fain part company from the
mystic: one is occupied in the fields of eternity, while
the other is pre-occupied upon the battlefield of time.
There is room for both in a world where time and eternity
alike are real, but the toil of the seer must not be
made subservient to that of the warrior.</p>

<p>Some of the lines of Whitman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hymn to the
Setting Sun&rdquo; recall the canticle which Brother Francis
used to sing among the olives:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Open mouth of my Soul, uttering gladness,</div>
<div class="verse">Eyes of my Soul, seeing perfection,</div>
<div class="verse">Natural life of me, faithfully praising things,</div>
<div class="verse">Corroborating for ever the triumph of things&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and it is all pregnant with the wonder of being. In
this it is like his earlier work, but it has added deeper
notes to its melody, and has won therewith a finer
rhythm. A mellow glory of the setting sun irradiates
it. All space, the poet reminds us, is filled with soul-life,
and the strong chords of that life awake the
rhythms of his praise for the joy of the Universal Being.</p>

<p>He greets death with equanimity, and it is this bell-note
of welcome to death which gives the full bass to
the first Boston edition. America, these poems and
their writer, and all the struggling creatures of life, are
to find their meaning in death, in transition; they are
to slough off what is no longer theirs and pass forward
into life. Are they then to lose individual identity?
No, the soul is identity, and they are of the soul; but
that in them which is not the soul will find its meaning
in death. There is a spiritual body, which the soul has
gathered about itself through the agency of the senses,
and that body the soul retains; but the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
senses dissolves and finds new uses and new meanings,
through death.</p>

<p>We may illustrate this thought from the life of the
whole tree, which is enriched by the life of every leaf.
When the sap withdraws from the leaf, and the leaf
shrivels and dies, and the frost and wind carry its
corpse away and mix it with the mire, the soul of the
leaf still lives in the tree. But the mere outer body,
which did but temporarily belong to the life of the leaf,
finds new value by its destruction and death. Who has
not felt the liberating joy of the autumn gales? Who
has not rejoiced among the trees, feeling with them the
sense of rest and quiescence in which the force of life
accumulates anew for expression and growth? But for
the fallen leaves also we may rejoice, since their atoms
have won something by contact with the life of the tree
which now they can communicate to the humble mire.</p>

<p>In another of these poems,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Whitman compares himself
with the historian. The latter studies the surface
of humanity, while in the former the inner self of the
race finds expression. Such is the difference between
an historian and a prophet. In another,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> carrying forward
a kindred thought, he declares that he has discovered
the story of the past, not in books but in the
actual present. To the seer, as to God, the past is not
gone by, but is clearly legible in the pages of our current
life, if only we would learn to read them. It is hidden
from our normal consciousness; but in certain phases
of consciousness to which, it would appear, Whitman
attained, it is revealed.</p>

<p>To this deeper consciousness Whitman looked for the
fulfilling of his own work and the integration of all
knowledge in the future. As men shall enter into it, he
believed, their work will show the clear evidence of an
underlying unity;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> it will cease to be fragmentary, and
our libraries, instead of being mere museums filled with
specimens, will become organic like a tree. Then the
sense of the cosmos will superintend all things that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span>
makes, as it superintends all the works of nature. A
unity already exists, but an unconscious unity, like that
of chaos.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> His own work is, of course, only a part; a
prelude to the universal hymn which later poets will
raise together. But it is a prelude, and this distinguishes
it from other contemporary verse.</p>

<p>America, the land of the Many-in-One, he had discovered
as the field for the new poetry.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> For the divine
unity is a living complex of variety. Every heart has
its own song, and yet the heart of all song is one.
Henceforward, he will go up and down America like
the sun, awakening the new seasons of the soul. Some
of his songs are especially for New York, others for the
West, the Centre or the South. But everywhere and to
all alike, they cry the messages of Reality, Equality, Immortality.
Neither do they cry only, but they actually
create. For song, he says, is no mere sound upon the
wind, born but to die; these songs of his are the most
real of realities; they will outlast centuries, supporting
the Democracy of the world.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The section which is specifically entitled <i>Leaves of
Grass</i> opens upon a note of that humility in which
Whitman is supposed to have failed. Throwing wholly
aside his egoism and pride, he identifies himself with
tiny and ephemeral things&mdash;the scum and weed which
the sea flings upon Paumanok&rsquo;s coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I Ebbed with the Ocean of Life&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> is a most
significant poem, which it is impossible to summarise
briefly. It appears to have been suggested by the experiences
of an autumn evening on the Long Island
beach, perhaps upon the then lonely sands of Coney
Island; an evening in which the divine pride of conscious
power and manhood, from which as a rule he
wrote in the exaltation of inspiration, ebbed away, and
left him struggling with the power of what he calls the
electric or eternal self, striving as it were against it to
retain his own individual consciousness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p>
<p>Although it is not easy to explain what he means, the
passage admirably suggests the complex inner experience
of his life at this period. It was filled with battles and
adventures of the spirit, and it kept his mind always
supplied with ample material for thought. It is no
wonder that the endeavour to explain himself, and to
keep some kind of record of these explorations and discoveries
in the Unknown occupied much of his time,
and that these years are somewhat barren of outward
incident. The inner experiences of so sane and stalwart
a man are of the utmost psychological interest,
and we cannot lay too much stress upon their importance
in Whitman&rsquo;s story, proving as they do the delicate
nervous organisation of the man.</p>

<p>As the struggle proceeds, Walt seems to be seized by
a strange new feeling. He is fascinated by the tiny
wind-rows left by the tide upon the sand, and the sense
of a likeness between himself and them arises in him,
taking the form not so much of a thought as of a consciousness
of kinship. The ocean scum and débris reminds
him how near to him is the infinite ocean of life
and death, and how he himself is but a little washed-up
drift, soon to be swallowed in the approaching waters.
Doubt overwhelms him; he seems to know nothing of all
that he thought he knew; his Soul and Nature make mock
at him. He admits that he is but as this tiny nothing.</p>

<p>This mood is a real one in Whitman. It is wrong to
think of him as a man who was always complacent and
cock-sure; all heroic faith must have its moments of
doubt, its crisis of despair, its cry of abandonment upon
the cross.</p>

<p>But they are moments only. If he is but this sea-drift,
yet he claims the shore as his father: &ldquo;I take
what is underfoot: what is yours, is mine, my father&rdquo;.
So he takes hold upon the Eternal Reality and communes
with it, praying that his lips may be touched
and utter the great mysteries; for otherwise, these will
overwhelm his being.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Pride, the full tide of life, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
soon flow again in our veins; but after all, what are we
but a strange complex of sea-drift and changing moods
strewed here at your feet? It is not pessimism but
humility which asks that question, the humility which
is part of a divine pride.</p>

<p>That pride refuses to blink anything; let us face it
all, even to the utmost, he keeps saying. He feels that
the soul can and must face all.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He has not to make a
theory or to justify himself, to uphold institutions, or
inculcate moralities; he has to open the doors of life in
faith. He has to let light in at all the windows. And
if it illumines ugliness as well as beauty, sin and shame
as well as virtue and pride&mdash;still it is his part to let in
the ever-glorious light. The more the light shines in,
the more the Soul is satisfied. In himself he recognises
sin and baseness and gives it expression, bringing
it to the light.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">(O admirers! praise not me! compliment not me! you make me wince,</div>
<div class="verse">I see what you do not&mdash;I know what you do not;)</div>
<div class="verse">Inside these breast-bones I lie smutch&rsquo;d and choked,</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath this face that appears so impassive, hell&rsquo;s tides continually run,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>But it is a mistake to think of the mystic, and especially
of Whitman, as the mere onlooker at life, and the
moralist as the practical person. There is ultimately of
course no distinction between mystic and moralist, the
mystic is the moralist become seer. And he is, perhaps,
even more strenuous in his life than is the moralist; but
life has now assumed for him a different aspect. He is
no longer pre-occupied by the hunger and thirst after
righteousness&mdash;for he feeds satisfied upon the divine
bread. He is not worried about sin, because he is conscious
of the antiseptic power of the Soul-life which
heals the sores of sin, and sloughs off the body of corruption.
What is evil passes away when life is earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
pursued. He sees that everything which exists at all,
however evil it may be, exists by reason of some virtue
or excellence which it possesses, and which fits it to its
environment. The wise soul uses the excellence of
things, and so things hurt it not at all. The things
that are not for it are evil to it; but in the sight of God
they are not evil, for all things have their value to Him.</p>

<p>Live your life, then, in faith, not in fear; such is the
word of the mystic. Condemn nothing; but learn what
is proper for your own need; and by sympathy, learn
to read the hearts about you, and help them also to live
according to the wisdom of the soul. Feed the soul,
think of the soul, exercise the soul&mdash;and the things, the
instincts, the thoughts that are evil to you now, will
presently cease to trouble you. For in Whitman&rsquo;s
universe the devil is dead.</p>

<p>It is this point of view, reached in his illumination,
which enabled him to look out upon all the shame and
evil of the world, and yet to rejoice. I doubt if he had
as yet justified this attitude to himself by any process
of reasoning; and it would be presumptuous in me to
attempt the task; he simply accepted it as the only
possible, or rather the ultimate and highest attitude of
the enlightened soul. When one discovers the soul,
that is the attitude in which she stands. The joy of the
soul fills the universe. Nothing any longer seems unworthy
of song. Not for its own sake, perhaps, but for
that which it reveals to the soul. And in the exaltation
of this soul-sight he sings.</p>

<p>Towards the end of this section, there is a little group
of poems which deal with the voice.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Whitman recognised
that the human voice is capable of expressing more
than mere thoughts. For the whole man speaks in the
voice; and as the soul becomes conscious, the voice
gains in actual timbre, and wins besides a mystical
authority over the heart of the hearer. Each word
spoken by the awakened soul is freighted with fuller
meaning than it carried before, and every word so spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
has a beauty which the soul gives it. He illustrates a
kindred thought by dwelling upon the different meanings
which his own name assumes in different mouths.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
It would seem as though he realised that power of the
name which is familiar to some uncivilised peoples and
has been largely forgotten by us.</p>

<p>The section closes with a poignant little verse<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> which
declares with all the passion of conviction, that this
paper is not paper, nor these words mere words; but
that this is the Man Walt Whitman, who hails you
here and cries farewell. The book is a sacrament; it is
the wafer and wine of a Real Presence; it is a symbol
pregnant with personality; it is no book, it is a man.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lift me close to your face till I whisper,</div>

<p>The <i>Salut au Monde</i> carries this <i>Ave atque Vale</i> to each
and all.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of &ldquo;A Word out of The Sea&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> in
which Whitman relates an incident of his childhood on
the Long Island coast. This is among the most melodious
of his chants; and though Death and Love are
the themes of all great poets it would be difficult to
quote any passage more suggestive of the pathetic mystery
of bereavement, than the song which he puts to the
notes of the widowed mocking-bird. The bird&rsquo;s song
has purposes unknown to its singer, meanings which are
caught by the boy&rsquo;s heart, and awaken there a strange
passion and wild chaos, that Death, whose voice is as
the accompaniment of the sea to the cry of the bird, can
alone soothe and order. It is impossible to read this
poem and think of its author as ignorant of personal
love and personal loss. The notes of despair and
triumph blend together here and elsewhere in this
edition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span></p>
<p>We turn now to the <i>Enfans d&rsquo;Adam</i>, poems of sex,
whose name is suggested by Whitman&rsquo;s outlook on life
as on a garden of Eden, and by his conception of himself
as it were a reincarnate Adam, begetter of a new
race of happier men.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>These are the poems which formed the storm-centre
of Emerson&rsquo;s discussion. They celebrate the love of the
body for its correlative body, the bridegroom&rsquo;s for the
bride&rsquo;s; and they celebrate the concern of the soul in
reproduction. The proof and law of all life is that it go
forth from itself in fertilising power, that it beget or
conceive; and without this, life and love would be bereft
of glory. And more: for Whitman broke wholly with
that mysticism which once saw in the organs of sex a
deformity consequent upon man&rsquo;s fall; he beheld them
rather as the vessels of a divine communion.</p>

<p>From this mystical view of Whitman&rsquo;s, Emerson
would conceivably have found no reason for dissent, but
the new mysticism was full-blooded and masculine. It
sprang out of experience, and was in no respect a substitute
for it. When he wrote of the body, Walt used
the word mystically it is true, but he meant the body
nevertheless, using the word to the full of its meaning.
He was very far from the abstract philosophic idealism
which we usually and often unfairly associate with the
transcendentalism of Concord. Thoreau, for example,
the Oriental dreamer, had been thrilled through by the
bloody and even brutal fanaticism of John Brown.</p>

<p>Yet Whitman&rsquo;s virility was different from theirs.
His celebration of passion was as honest and frank as
Omar&rsquo;s praise of the vine. To him, the begetting of
children seemed in itself more satisfying to the soul than
any words could express. It needed no apologist; but
rose out of the region of cold ethics in the divine glow
of its ecstatic reality.</p>

<p>Such an attitude, it seems to me, is only possible to a
man who has known true love, and has lived a chaste and
temperate life. And these poems, far from representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
Whitman as a man of dissolute habits, indubitably afford
the clearest proof, if it were needed, of his temperance
and self-control; but that is, happily, a matter which is
beyond dispute. He was not a man to seek unlawful
pleasures, or to approach life&rsquo;s mysteries irreverently,
neither was he a man to treat womanhood, even when
it had covered itself with shame, with anything but the
utmost gentleness and chivalry. It was in the cause of
womanhood, if we can say that it was in any cause, that
he wrote his poems of sex, seeking, for woman&rsquo;s sake, to
wipe away the shame that still clings about paternity.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
The physical rites of love were beautiful to his sight;
and he sought to tear away the obscene draperies and
skulking thoughts by which they have been hidden.</p>

<p>With this in view, he added an inventory of all the
items of the flesh to his poem of &ldquo;The Body Electric,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
intended as are all his lists to make the subsequent
generalisation more actual. These, he said, are the
parts of the soul. For matter and mind are twin aspects
of the one reality, which is the soul. All knowledge
comes to the soul through the senses, and if we put
shame upon any function of the body we cripple something
in the soul.</p>

<p>In a singular phrase,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> he declares that he will be the
robust husband of the true women of America, the
women who await him; meaning, I suppose, that
through the medium of his book, he will quicken in
those who are fearless and receptive, the conception of
the new Humanity. He is Adam, destined to be the
father of a new race, by the women who are able to
receive him. Sexual imagery is rightly used in this connection,
not only because it is according to mystical precedent,
but because sex is the profoundest of the passions,
as much spiritual as physical, and all reproductive energy
is sexual. Whitman believed that until this was recognised,
religion and art must remain comparatively
sterile.</p>

<p>The question which these poems raise is far too large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
and too delicate for full discussion in this place. And its
discussion is rendered more difficult because, present as
it is in most of our minds, it is in many still unripe for
words. The soul knows its own needs and its own hours,
and pages like these of Whitman&rsquo;s are not for every
reader. Whitman knew it, and many a time in this
volume he asks whether it were not better for you to
put the book aside. As for himself, the time had come
when these things must be uttered.</p>

<p>The soul must take experience in its own time; but
Whitman was convinced that without initiation into the
mysteries of love, much of life must remain an enigma
to the individual. It was, it would appear, after initiation
that he himself had realised his identity with all
things. We speak sometimes of the bestial side of our
nature, forgetting that when love illuminates it, it is
this side in particular which redeems all that before
seemed gross among the creatures.</p>

<p>True to his determination to include all, even the
outcast, in his synthesis, Whitman, in another poem,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
companions publicly with sinners and with harlots. He
shares their nature also; they, too, have their place.
But if he says they are just as good as the best, it is
only when seen by the eyes of a Divine Love. He, as
much as any man, realises the handicap of sin; in the
end the soul must conquer; but think how sin&mdash;the
sin of the Pharisee and of the callous heart as much as
that of the prostitute&mdash;disfigures the temple of the soul,
and mars the spiritual with the outward body.</p>

<p>Temperate himself, Whitman&rsquo;s sympathy for those
who sin in the flesh was very real. And indeed for all
sins of passion he felt, perhaps, a special understanding.
The story runs that while he was still in Boston,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> he
met a lad he had known in New York, who was now,
after a drunken brawl, in which he believed he had killed
a companion, escaping from the American police to
Canada. The young fellow told Walt his story, and
was sent upon his way with that comrade&rsquo;s kiss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
affection which meant so much more than good advice
or charity.</p>

<p>Before closing this section, Whitman returns<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> to the
Adamic idea, as though to make his meaning unmistakable.
In him, Adam has nearly circled the
world, and now looks out across the Pacific to his first
birth-place in the East; and still his work is unaccomplished.
Still must he go on seeking for his bride, the
Future. The passion of creation is upon him, he is
strained with yearning for that towards which his soul
gravitates.</p>

<p>As we finish these poems, we remember how at this
time their author impressed those who approached him
with two equal qualities, his force and his purity: for
great passion is a clear wine in a chaste vessel. He
had a right to say as his last word on this subject, &ldquo;be
not afraid of my body&rdquo;; for, indeed, it was his soul,
enamoured of all things, wholesome and pure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After these poems, comes the &ldquo;Song of the Road,&rdquo;
and other familiar pieces, and then another group
wholly new. These appear to have been written in the
autumn of 1859,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and are called <i>Calamus</i>; a name
either for a reed or for the sweet-flag,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> which occurs
in the Bible and in the pages of Greek and Latin
writers, but is here used of a common American pond-reed,
a sort of tall sedge or great spear of grass, a yard
or so in height, emitting a pungent watery smell, whose
root is used for chewing. In these poems he asserts the
soul&rsquo;s need of society, for life and growth. The gospel
of self-realisation thus becomes a social gospel, and the
thought gives a political significance to these, the most
esoteric of all Whitman&rsquo;s poems.</p>

<p>He seems more than usually sensitive about them,
and dreads to have them misunderstood. Proud and
jealous, he would drive all but a few away from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
confidences. They are only intended, he says,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> for
his comrades; for it is only they who will understand
them.</p>

<p>But in the more obvious sense the poems are for all.
It is to comradeship and not to institutions that Whitman
looks for a political redemption. He will bind
America indissolubly together into the fellowship of his
friends.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Their friendship shall be called after him,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
and in his name they shall solve all the problems of
Freedom, and bring America to victory. Lovers are
the strength of Liberty, comrades perpetuate Equality;
America will be established above disaster by the love
of her poet&rsquo;s lovers.</p>

<p>Then he turns to himself and his own friends, or
rather, perhaps, to his own conscious need for friends.
It is curious when one thinks of it, that we have no
record of any close friendship, save that of Emerson,
dating from these days. And he who knew and loved
so many men and women, seems to have carried forward
with him no equal friendship from the years of
his youth. In this respect, he was solitary as a pioneer.
He longed for Great Companions, but he did not meet
them at this time upon the open road of daily intercourse.</p>

<p>Yet was he not alone. Some say he wrote of comradeship
because he never found such a comrade as him
of whom he wrote;<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> but in one at least of these poems
he declares that his life, or at the least his singing,
depends upon such comradeship. And the absence of
any record merely reminds us that Whitman was chary
of committing such personal matters to the keeping of
a note-book. What record has he left of those women
and their children, whose relation to himself must have
bulked so largely in the world of his soul? The poems
seem to indicate at least one very intimate friendship,
more passionately given than returned.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as on the beach of Paumanok, doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
oversets him. Perhaps after all,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> appearances do not
mean what he sees in them. Perhaps the reality, the
purpose, lies still undiscovered in them. Perhaps the
identity of the human self after death is but a beautiful
fable. There is a perfect answer&mdash;shall we say an
evasion?&mdash;of these questionings and of all doubts,
which fellowship provides.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answered by my lovers, my dear friends;</div>
<div class="verse">When he whom I love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the hand,</div>
<div class="verse">When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,</div>
<div class="verse">Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom&mdash;I am silent&mdash;I require nothing further,</div>
<div class="verse">I cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the grave,</div>
<div class="verse">But I walk or sit indifferent&mdash;I am satisfied,</div>
<div class="verse">He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then he praises Love; all other joys and enterprises
of the heroic soul become but little things when weighed
against the life of fellowship, the joy of the presence of
the beloved.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Is this another of those places where the
moralist begs to take his leave of the mystic? Let us
beseech him to stay, for it is out of the strenuous passions
of the soul that all good and lasting works for humanity
have sprung. It was the face of Beatrice&mdash;and for the
Italian, it could only have been her face&mdash;which drew
Dante down through the circles of horror and up the
steep slopes of Purgatory to Paradise. It was the
beauty of the lady Poverty, that enabled her lover to
kiss the sores of the lepers in the lazar house below
Assisi. What would the Apostles have done in the
name of their Lord had they not, like Mary the mystic,
chosen the better part of communion with Him instead
of fidgetting forever, with Martha, upon the errands of
duty?</p>

<p>He writes of Love&rsquo;s tragedy, and refusal; of the
measured love returned for the infinite love accorded.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
But oftener he dwells upon its joy. The air becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
alive with music he had never heard before.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> The
passion in his heart responds to a passion of which
hitherto he had not dreamed, hidden in the heart of the
world, awaiting its hour to break forth. And as these
poems have come slowly up from out of the inner purpose
of things, to find utterance upon Whitman&rsquo;s pages, so
slowly will their meaning arise in the hearts of those
that read them.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> It is not to be guessed in a moment.
For they are freighted with the mystery which unfolds
in the patience of the soul.</p>

<p>Although he warns his reader from time to time to
beware of him, for he is not at all the man he seems, a
note of yearning for confidence cannot be suppressed.
He confesses that his very life-blood speaks in these
pages,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and that his soul is heavy with infinite passion
for the love of its Comrades that shall be. Sometimes,
as he passes a stranger in the streets, he knows in himself
that once they were each other&rsquo;s; some deep chord
of life thrilling, as though with memory, to promise that
they will yet come together again.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Ah, how many and
many an one of these his mystic kin must the lands of
the earth contain! It is not America only, but the whole
human race that he will bind at last into his fellowship,
laughing at institutions and at laws, persuading all men
by the power of the Soul which is in all.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> One institution
there is which he confesses<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> that he would inaugurate.
Let men who love one another kiss when they meet,
and walk hand in hand. It is no mere sentiment; he
sees that love must have its witness. In warm manly
love is the mightiest power in the universe, a power that
laughs at oppressors and at death.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I trust it has already been sufficiently suggested that
Whitman&rsquo;s mysticism is not to be confused with much
that hitherto has passed under that name. Mysticism
it is, for it is the expression of mystical experience; but
it is clearly not the mysticism which is completed in
a circle of devotion, religious exercises, meditation and
ecstasy. It is the mysticism which recreates the world
in a new image. Professor Royce, in his most interesting
lectures on &ldquo;The World and the Individual,&rdquo; has
described it, or something very similar to it, under the
title of Idealism; and his careful and suggestive elaboration
of his theme is the best indirect commentary upon
what I have called the mysticism of Whitman with
which I am acquainted. It includes an admirable exposition
of the meaning of the Soul or Self.</p>

<p>Your whole world, he declares, is your whole Self&mdash;Whitman
would perhaps have said, it is the mirror
which reveals yourself. The Infinite Universe, whereof
yours is but a part, is the Self of God. We live, but are
not lost in Him, for we are as it were His members.
There are two aspects of the human self: the temporal,
in which it appears as a mere momentary consciousness,
and the eternal, which reveals it as an indestructible purpose,
the essence of reality. For reality, the professor
argues, is the visible expression of purpose or meaning.</p>

<p>To proceed to the social aspect of this teaching: the
individual, when he becomes conscious of his world&mdash;his
Self&mdash;becomes conscious, too, that his world is only
one aspect of the Universe, that there are a myriad
others, and that the Universal Life consists of a Fellowship
of such Selves as his. Thus, God is the Many-in-One;
in Him the Many are one Self and complete.
And the Many do not only seek completion in the
Divine Unity; they also seek fellowship with one
another. The Divine life, which is the basis of Human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
life, is thus a life of Fellowship&mdash;as the Apostle says,
it is Love. It is not merely a trinity, it is a City of
Friends; or rather of Lovers, as Edward Carpenter
suggested in his recent essays.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Now I am convinced that this thought underlies
<i>Calamus</i>; not, indeed, as a metaphysical theory, but
as one of those overwhelming realisations of the ultimate
significance of things which I have described
inadequately as Whitman&rsquo;s symbolism. Seeking to
plumb the depths of passion, he found God. Sex became
for him, in its essence, the potency of that Life
wherein we are One. And comradeship, a passion as
intense as that of sex, he beheld as the same relation
between spiritual or ætherial bodies.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> He was aware
that the noblest of passions is the most liable to base
misunderstandings. But in it alone the soul finds full
freedom. Sex passion finds its proper expression in
physical rites, it is the passion of the life in Time; on
the contrary, the passion of comrades is of eternity and
only finds expression in Death.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> This appears to have
been Whitman&rsquo;s conviction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Yet another bundle follows <i>Calamus</i>; a packet of
more or less personal letters or messages called <i>Messenger
Leaves</i>. In subsequent editions they were sorted
out into other sections. They are not all new; but
among those that now appear for the first time are the
daring and noble lines to Jesus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">My spirit to yours, dear brother,</div>
<div class="verse">Do not mind because many, sounding your name, do not understand you,</div>
<div class="verse">I do not sound your name, but I understand you, (there are others also;)</div>
<div class="verse">I specify you with joy, O my comrade, to salute you, and to salute those who are with you, before and since&mdash;and those to come also,</div>
<div class="verse">That we all labour together, transmitting the same charge and succession;</div>
<div class="verse">We few, equals, indifferent of lands, indifferent of times,</div>
<div class="verse">We, enclosers of all continents, all castes&mdash;allowers of all theologies,</div>
<div class="verse">Compassionaters, perceivers, rapport of men,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
<div class="verse">We walk silent among disputes and assertions, but reject not the disputers, nor anything that is asserted, ...</div>
<div class="verse">Till we saturate time and eras, that the men and women of races, ages to come, may prove brethren and lovers, as we are.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Scattered through the generations&mdash;so we may read his
thought&mdash;are those who have come into the cosmic consciousness
or larger life, who have passed beyond the
reach of time and of mere argument, and who therefore
understand one another as others cannot understand
them. The love and communion which exists between
such Great Companions, is a pledge and earnest of the
Society of the Future, when all men shall be one, even
as these are one.</p>

<p>The thought may shock those to whom it comes suddenly,
if they see in Whitman the &ldquo;mere man&rdquo; of
their own narrow conception of humanity. But in
judging him we must remember that he openly claims
for himself and for other men all the Divine attributes
which Christians are in the habit of ascribing to their
Lord. Whitman believed that Jesus identified himself
with Humanity; and that all who enter, as he entered,
into the cosmic life share in the fellowship of God, even
as did he.</p>

<p>More fully than many Christians, Whitman recognised
Jesus as literally his elder brother; he joined with
him in the words &ldquo;Our Father,&rdquo; feeling them to be
true. And as one reads the gospel narratives one ventures
to believe that the Master who called the disciples
his friends, would himself have been eager to welcome
the assertion of such a relationship.</p>

<p>Another letter<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> is to one about to die; it is filled not
with melancholy but with congratulation. The body
that dies is but an excrement, the Self is eternal and
goes on into ever fuller sunlight.</p>

<p>Another,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> which has aroused perhaps more misunderstanding
than anything which Whitman wrote, is
addressed to a prostitute. It hardly seems to call for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span>
explanation; for it is like the simple offering of the hand
of friendship to an outcast; the assertion that for her,
too, Whitman&rsquo;s living eternal comradeship is real and
close, accompanied by the injunction that she be worthy
of such friendship.</p>

<p>He writes to rich givers<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> in the Franciscan spirit; for
he that is willing to give all, is able to accept.</p>

<p>To a pupil<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> he suggests that personality is the tool of
all good work and usefulness. To be magnetic is to be
great. Come then and first become yourself.</p>

<p>But it is impossible even to refer in passing to all
the separate poems, each one with its living suggestion.
Some of the briefest are not the least pregnant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The book closes with poems of departure. A dread
falls upon him;<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> perhaps after all he may not linger, to
go to and fro through the lands he loves, awakening
comrades; presently his voice also will cease. But here
and now at least his soul has appeared and been realised;
and that in itself should be enough.</p>

<p>Then he says his farewell. His words have been for
his own era; and in every age, the race must find anew
its own poets for its own words. But till America shall
have absorbed his message, he must stand, and his
influence, his spirit, must endure.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> After all, he does
but seek, with passionate longing, one worthier than
himself, who yet shall take his place. For him, he has
prepared.</p>

<p>Now is he come to die. Without comprehending or
questioning, he has obeyed his mystical commission; he
has sown the Divine seed with which he was entrusted;
he has given the message with which he was burdened,
to women and to young men; now he passes on into
the state for which all experience and service has been
preparing him. He ceases to sing. His work is accomplished.
Now disembodied and free, he can respond to
all that love him, and enter upon the intenser Reality
of the Unknown.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center">AMERICA AT WAR</p>


<p class="p2">The new edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> pleased the critics
as little as its predecessors, but had a wider circulation.
Some four or five thousand copies had been sold
before the house of Thayer and Eldridge went down in
the financial crash which followed on the outbreak of
the war.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Emerson came in again for some share of
the critical assault, though his name was in no way
connected with the new issue. Of Whitman himself a
London journalist declared<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> that he was the most silly,
the most blasphemous, and the most disgusting writer
that he had ever perused.</p>

<p>But if it found fresh enemies, the new edition found
also new friends; and notably in England, whither a
few adventurous copies of the earlier versions had
already penetrated. Both Emerson and Thoreau had
sent them to their English friends&mdash;among whom was
Carlyle&mdash;but apparently with scant acknowledgment.
Ruskin&rsquo;s correspondent, Mr. Thomas Dixon of Sunderland,
had purchased a few examples of the first edition
at Dutch auction; and some of these he forwarded to
Mr. William Bell Scott, who again handed on one of
them to Mr. W. M. Rossetti; an act which, as the
story will show, proved to be of great importance to
Walt Whitman.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> It was the book of 1860, however,
which first aroused the younger generation of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>men,
among whom was the late Mr. Addington Symonds.
&ldquo;Within the space of a few years,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we were
all reading and discussing Walt.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The book appeared under the shadow of impending
war. With the Presidential election of 1860, America
came to the edge of the abyss; and the return of Abraham
Lincoln was promptly followed by the organisation
of secession. Whitman was still in Boston when, early
in the spring, Lincoln first made his appearance in
New York, W. C. Bryant introducing him to a great
meeting at the Cooper Institute.</p>

<p>The famous speech which he then delivered lived long
in its hearers&rsquo; memory; but even the personal impression
which he made, remarkable as it was, hardly prepared
New York to learn in the following May that it was
Abraham Lincoln, and not W. H. Seward, the nominal
leader of the Republican party, who had received the
Presidential nomination at the great Chicago Convention.</p>

<p>Had the Democratic party been able to hold together,
Lincoln could not have carried the election; but it was
now split, and further weakened by the appearance of a
Constitutional Union Party.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The most dangerous of
the opposing candidates seemed to be Lincoln&rsquo;s old
antagonist and subsequent loyal supporter, Judge
Douglas, who represented his well-worn policy of local
option, or &ldquo;squatter sovereignty&rdquo;. Breckinridge of
Kentucky openly advocated the extension of slave territory;
while Bell, the Unionist, kept his own counsel.</p>

<p>Early in the summer of that great struggle, Whitman
returned to New York. In June<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> he was among the
immense crowd of interested spectators who filled Broadway
from side to side, on the arrival of the first
Japanese embassy to America; and he was of the
thousands who welcomed the succession of distinguished
visitors who came, that ominous summer, to the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
of the West. There was the <i>Great Eastern</i>, that leviathan
of the modern world, whose advent was so long
and so eagerly anticipated; there was Garibaldi, fresh
from the fields whereon Italy had become a kingdom&mdash;not
indeed the sister republic of Mazzini&rsquo;s ardent dream,
who should have given the new law of Liberty to Europe,
but at least something more than a memory and a geographical
term.</p>

<p>Another, in whom Whitman felt an even warmer
interest, was &ldquo;Baron Renfrew,&rdquo; otherwise the Prince
of Wales. The fair royal stripling of those days attracted
the stalwart Democrat, who like old George Fox,
could recognise a man under a crown as readily as a
man in rags. Whitman&rsquo;s eyes were keen to read personality;
perhaps we should rather say that the sense
by which personality is distinguished was highly developed
in him. And he to whom the attributes of
rank were non-existent, fell in love with this young
man<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> whose warm heart was to make him perhaps the
best beloved of monarchs, as he afterwards fell in love
with many a private soldier carried in wounded from the
field. Albert Edward was one of those strangers in
whom Whitman recognised a born comrade; and this
fact at once raises his democratic sentiment out of the
region of class feeling.</p>

<p>He was a witness, too, of the advent of other visitors
even more brilliant, and burdened even more to the
popular fancy, and perhaps to his own, with significance.
He saw the extraordinary display of the heavens&mdash;the
huge meteor, luminous almost as the moon, which fell
in Long Island Sound, and the unannounced comet
flaring in the north.</p>

<p>The autumn was loud with the electoral struggle.
The presence of three opposing candidates was not
enough to assure Lincoln&rsquo;s success. The general expectation
seems to have leaned towards an electoral tie,
none of the candidates polling a majority of the votes;
and this would have resulted, as on the similar occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
of 1824, in the choice between them being left to the
House of Representatives. Upon the result of such
choice the slave party was willing to stake its hopes of
success; anticipating that even though he were the
popular candidate, Congress would not select Lincoln,
but would put him aside, as it had passed by Jackson in
its previous opportunity.</p>

<p>But to the consternation of the South, the &ldquo;black
Republican&rdquo; rail-splitter polled a clear majority over all
three antagonists combined. A majority, that is to say,
of electoral votes, for the American President is not
chosen directly by the people, but by the people&rsquo;s delegates.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Each State elects its quota of Presidential
electors, chosen not in proportion to the strength of
parties in the State, but all of them representing the
dominant party.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Thus it may happen that a candidate,
like Judge Douglas, who polls a large minority of the
total popular vote, will receive a mere handful of electoral
suffrages, having failed to carry more than one or two
States. Lincoln was chosen by 180 votes to 123; and
though Douglas&rsquo;s popular poll was two-thirds of Lincoln&rsquo;s,
and nearly as large as that of the two other
candidates combined, his electoral support was only
one-tenth of the voices against Lincoln. The Republican
vote in the country fell short of the combined
opposition poll by a million out of a total of less than
five million votes. From the popular point of view,
Lincoln was, therefore, in the difficult position of a
minority President.</p>

<p>The result of the November elections was scarcely
made public before a committee of Southern Congressmen
issued a manifesto,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> proclaiming the immediate
need for a separate Confederacy of slave-holding States,
if the institution upon which their prosperity depended
was to be saved from the machinations of Northern
politicians. They audaciously identified both Lincoln
and the Republican party with the policy of Abolition;
whereas the choice of Lincoln instead of Seward, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
Abolitionist, might in itself have been accepted as sufficient
evidence that the North, while determined to
preserve the Union, was resolute against interference
with the internal policy of the South.</p>

<p>The Manifesto was followed, on the 20th of December,
by the secession of South Carolina, ever since Calhoun&rsquo;s
day the leader of revolt against Federal power. Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana promptly
joined her.</p>

<p>Although Lincoln&rsquo;s election was assured in November,
the executive power remained till the beginning of March
in the feeble hands of Buchanan, who was the creature
of advisers themselves divided in counsel, to the signal
advantage of that section which supported the revolt.
When, at last, the outgoing President made up his mind
to dismiss his secessionist secretary of war, the Cotton-State
Caucus called a Convention at Montgomery, the
picturesque and sleepy old capital of Alabama; and this
finally formulated a permanent constitution for the Confederacy
precisely a week after the inauguration of the
new President.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime Lincoln could only stand a spectator
of the wholly ineffective measures which were being taken
to frustrate the active aggression of the slave power.
But towards the end of February he set out for Washington.
Passing on his way through Indiana and Ohio,
he was received by an enormous crowd in New York;
and here Whitman first saw him, not from his favourite
seat upon a stage-coach, for the streets were too densely
packed for traffic, but as one of the thirty or forty
thousand silent pedestrian onlookers collected in the
city&rsquo;s heart, where now the post-office stands.</p>

<p>Whitman well knew what the ominous silence, which
greeted that loosely-made gaunt figure, concealed;<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and
how different was the mood of New York that day from
the holiday-making good-humour with which it was wont
to greet the arrival of other illustrious guests. Under
the speechlessness lurked a black moody wrath ready
to break forth.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span></p>
<p>It was a pleasant afternoon, just twelve months after
that other February day when Whitman and Emerson
had paced up and down the slope of Boston Common in
earnest colloquy. Lincoln went silently into the Astor
House without any demonstration either of welcome or
of open hostility; thereafter proceeding to his inauguration.
He was compelled to pass secretly through Baltimore,
where violence was only too ready to manifest
itself on the slightest encouragement. The fact that
the President-elect, in order to reach the capital, had
thus to travel through a State which was only with
difficulty retained for the Union cause, shows how close
that cause was to disaster. And though, as Lincoln
stated in his inaugural address, the bulk of the American
people opposed secession, and the party which favoured
it was but a comparatively small minority; yet it could
only be either an ignorant optimism, or on the contrary a
firmly founded and earnest faith in the devotion of the
great mass of the citizens to the ideals of their fathers,
which could face such a situation without dismay.</p>

<p>The weight of numbers, however, favoured the North.
A review of the census returns show that at their first
compilation in 1790 the population of the Southern and
the Northern divisions of the country was almost absolutely
equal; but that from the beginning of the century
the increase in the latter was the more rapid; so that
in 1860 the free population of the North was more than
double that of the South.</p>

<p>But in spite of this great numerical preponderance,
the North itself was not united on the question at issue,
as is clearly shown by the returns of the Presidential
election, when Douglas polled a million Free-state votes.
For though Douglas opposed secession, he did not
oppose the extension of slavery. It is shown clearly,
too, in the attitude of New York; of which more, later.</p>

<p>And beyond this the Southerner was in some respects
better fitted, as well by his virtues as by his faults, for a
military life. The qualities of leadership and of obedience
are cultivated under an aristocratic ideal, as they are
not under a democratic. And the South, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
practically controlled the executive under Buchanan,
and especially the department of war, was better prepared
to take the field than was the North. On the
other hand, the strength of the Union lay in its cause,
and in the latent idealism of the American people, which
woke into activity at the first menace to the Stars and
Stripes.</p>

<p>Whether the war really settled anything, whether it
might possibly have been avoided, whether secession
left to itself would not literally have cut its own throat,
these are interesting philosophic speculations into which
we need not enter. For already the spectre of war had
long been abroad, stalking through the unharvested fields
of Kansas and Nebraska, and gesticulating with horrid
signs and mocking whispers in every corner of America.
When the slave party had first raised its fatal cry of
&ldquo;our institution in danger,&rdquo; it had raised the cry of
war. And when at last men like Lincoln retorted with
the declaration that the Union was irrefragable&mdash;that
secession could only be justified after some criminal use
of the Federal power to override the rights of the
minority&mdash;the battle was manifestly joined.</p>

<p>It is but fair to add that although the party of Lincoln
had now truly become the party of the Union, the first
line of cleavage between North and South was marked
out by a schismatic spirit in the North itself, by its
support of its own sectional interests, when enforcing
a policy of protection upon the whole country.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> There
can be little doubt that the mistrust felt in the South,
while largely due to anterior causes, was born under
this evil star. So true does it seem that when a
nation&rsquo;s policy is being shaped according to merely
material interests, the seeds are being sown of future
revolution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fatal movement of American destiny towards its
crisis must have dominated much of Whitman&rsquo;s thought
at this time. Secession was in the very air he breathed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
for at its first proclamation an echoing voice was heard
in New York itself.</p>

<p>Here Mayor Wood, after a short period of deserved
seclusion, had returned to power. Unsatisfied with his
patronage he dreamed of wider fields. Was it not the
splendid vision of a Presidency which encouraged this
fatuous person to declare for a second secession, the
creation of a new island republic of New York? &ldquo;<span class="correction" title="In the original book: Tri-insula">Tri-Insula</span>&rdquo;
was to have been its title,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and its territories
would have comprised Mannahatta, Staten, and Long
Islands. The proposal was enthusiastically received by
the absurd creatures of Tammany, who then sat upon
the City Council. But their complacent folly was of
brief duration. It was dispersed by the first rebel
gun-shot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman had been at the opera on Fourteenth Street,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
and was strolling homeward down Broadway about midnight,
on the 13th of April, when he was met by the
newspaper boys crying the last extras with more than
ordinary vehemence. Buying a copy and stopping to
read it under the lamps of the Metropolitan Hotel,
he was startled by the news that war had actually
broken out. The day before, Confederate troops had
fired upon the flag at Charleston Harbour and Fort
Sumter. South Carolina had flung her challenge down.</p>

<p>The President immediately called for troops, and the
response of the North was instantaneous. New York
herself did not hesitate, but voted at once a million
dollars and sent forward her quota of men.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Mayor
Wood was among the many thousands of Democrats
who became patriots that day&mdash;in so far as one can
suddenly become patriotic.</p>

<p>Whitman was not among the volunteers, but his
brother George, who was ten years his junior, was
one of the first to offer.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> He had been following the
family trade as a Brooklyn carpenter, and henceforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
proved himself a brave and able soldier. He was neither
braver nor abler than Walt, but the latter stayed at
home, and there are those who have blamed him for it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i179.jpg" width="600" height="787" alt="Picture of Walt at forty-four." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN AT FORTY-FOUR</p></div>
</div>

<p>Putting on one side, as they have done, his subsequent
service to the army, such blame springs from a misunderstanding
of the man&rsquo;s nature. There are some men
wholly above the reproach of cowardice or indifference,
whom it is impossible for us to conceive as shouldering a
gun. And for those who knew him most intimately,
Whitman was such a man. Many men who loved peace
heard the call to arms and obeyed. Abraham Lincoln<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
himself&mdash;to whom America was entrusting the conduct
of the war&mdash;had but now proclaimed its futility,
while his whole nature revolted from its cruel folly.
And had his destiny bidden him to join the colours
one cannot doubt that Walt Whitman would have done
so.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> But that inner voice, which he obeyed, rather
forbade than encouraged him.</p>

<p>And even in years of war there is service one can do
for one&rsquo;s country out of the ranks. No war can wholly
absorb the energies of a civilised people, for the daily
life of the nation must be continued. There are, besides,
tasks that have a prior claim upon the loyalty of the
individual, even to the defence of the flag. And Whitman
had such a task, for he bore, as it were, within
his soul the infant of an ideal America, like a young
mother whose life is the consecrated guardian of her
unborn babe. His book was now, in a sense, complete;
but none could feel more strongly than he that even
his book was only an inadequate expression of his purpose;
while life lasted his days were to be devoted to
the creation of an immortal comradeship, and a spiritual
atmosphere in which the seeds concealed in his writings
might germinate.</p>

<p>It must also be noted that, though in his open letter
to Emerson<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> he had written of war almost as a soldier
whose blood kindles at the sound of the trumpets, and
though the spirit of his book is one which &ldquo;blows battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
into men,&rdquo; yet the last edition had been marked by a
curious and significant approximation to Quakerism. It
was in 1860, when war was so near at hand, that he
substituted the Friendly numeral equivalents for the
usual names of the months and days of the week; not,
assuredly, because he objected to the recognition of
heathen deities, like the early Friends, but in order to
avow some relationship between himself and Quakerism.
The increase of mystical consciousness may have made
him more aware at this time of his real identity with this
society of mystics to which he never nominally belonged.</p>

<p>We have had repeated occasion to note the Quaker
traits in Whitman&rsquo;s character, and here, at the opening
of the war, it is well to emphasise them anew.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> His
love of silence, his spiritual caution, his veracity and
simplicity of speech, his soul-sight, and the practical
balance of his mysticism&mdash;that temperance of character
upon which his inspirational faculties were founded&mdash;and,
finally, the equal democratic goodwill he showed
to all men; these qualities speak the original Quaker
type. And the world may well extend to Whitman
the respect it acknowledges for the Quaker&rsquo;s refusal
to bear arms.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, because he loved America so well that
he did not fight with the common weapons. We have
seen that he associated himself intimately with the
American genius, a genius which necessarily includes
the qualities of the South at least equally with those of
the North; he himself<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> inclining to lay the emphasis
upon the Southern attributes, as though their wealth
in the emotional and passionate elements were more
essential than any other. America robbed of the South
would, indeed, have been America divided against herself.
Hence he shared to the full in the desire and
struggle for unity against the sordid party which instigated
secession. But he knew that a victory of arms
was not necessarily a victory of principles, and it was
for the principle that he strove.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span></p>
<p>May we not assert the possibility of a highly developed
and powerful personality exerting itself upon the side
of Justice and Liberty in moments of national crisis, in
some manner more potent than that of merely physical
service? Would not Whitman have been wasting his
forces if he had surrendered himself to the spirit of the
hour, and gone forth with the volunteers to stop or to
forward a bullet or a bayonet? These are questions
we well may ponder, and without attempting to give
reasons for so doing, we may answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Certain it is that two or three days after he first
read the news of South Carolina&rsquo;s challenge, and the
day following the President&rsquo;s appeal, he recorded this
singular vow in one of his notebooks as though it were
the seal upon a struggle of his spirit: &ldquo;April 16th, 1861.
I have this day, this hour, resolved to inaugurate for
myself a pure, perfect, sweet, clean-blooded, robust
body, by ignoring all drinks but water and pure milk,
and all fat meats, late suppers&mdash;a great body, a purged,
cleansed, spiritualised, invigorated body.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Read with its context of the events which were
occupying his mind, may we not surmise that this was
a new girding of the loins for some service of the great
cause, more strenuous than ever, though perhaps yet
undefined; that this vow of abstinence for the establishment
of a spiritualised body, made thus at the
opening of the war, and at the time of George&rsquo;s enrolment,
when Lincoln&rsquo;s call for volunteers was ringing in
the heart of every loyal citizen<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>&mdash;that this vow was
that of an athlete going into training for a supreme
effort; and an athlete whose labours are upon that
unseen field, whereon it may be the battles of the
visible world are really won. It was thus that Whitman
obeyed the calls of duty both within him and without.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lincoln&rsquo;s first tasks were to create an army and to
confine the area of insurrection. He proclaimed the
blockade of the Southern ports; called out more regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>lars
and volunteers, and succeeded in preventing West
Virginia and Missouri from joining the Confederacy.
Had he been able to retain for the service of the Union
a certain brilliant young officer, the war might have
opened and closed upon a very different story; but
Robert Lee had already joined the Southern army,
though not without an inward conflict.</p>

<p>No leader of equal genius appeared upon the other
side until Grant came out of the West. The weakness
of Northern generalship was only too clearly evidenced
in the defeat at Bull Run, midway between the two
capitals, which were now little more than a hundred
miles apart, the Confederate Government having removed
to Richmond. As a result of the defeat Washington
itself lay in imminent peril; and if General
Johnston had followed up his advantage, it would have
fallen into his hands. But he missed his hour, and the
consternation of the North was followed by a mood of
stubborn resolution.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely Lincoln built up his military
organisation. In the whirlpool of currents he remained
steadfast to his single policy of maintaining the
Union. He succeeded in evading the occasions of war
which threatened abroad; he conciliated all in the South
which was at that time amenable to conciliation; and,
eager as he was for emancipation, he refused to be
driven before the storm of Abolitionist sentiment which
had risen in the North.</p>

<p>During 1862, while Grant and Farragut were
gradually clearing the Mississippi, the great natural
thoroughfare of America, Lee was more than holding
his own among the hills and rivers of Virginia. The
opposing army of the Potomac remained ineffective
under the brilliant but dilatory McClellan, and his more
active successors, Burnside and Hooker. Lee assumed
the aggressive, and invaded Maryland; but was turned
back from a projected raid into Pennsylvania by the
drawn battle of Antietam; in which, as in many of the
previous engagements of this army, George Whitman
fought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Antietam was immediately followed by the preliminary
proclamation of emancipation, to take effect in
all States which should still continue in rebellion at the
commencement of the new year. Lincoln&rsquo;s mind had
long been exercised upon the best means of compassing
the liberation of the slaves; and until the close of the
war, he himself looked for the ultimate solution of the
problem to the method of compensation adopted by
Great Britain in the West Indies. This was successfully
applied to the district of Columbia, but the offer of
it received no response either from the other States to
which it was magnanimously made, or from Lincoln&rsquo;s
own Cabinet. The present proclamation was intended
as a blow at the industrial resources of the rebellion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In mid-December General Burnside lost nearly 13,000
men at Fredericksburg, Virginia, and reading the long
lists of wounded, the Whitmans came upon George&rsquo;s
name among the more serious casualties.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Great was
the distress in the home on Portland Avenue, and Walt
set off at once to seek him at the front. His pocket
was picked in a crush at Philadelphia Station, and he
arrived penniless in Washington.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> There, searching the
hospitals for three days and nights, he could get no
news of his brother&rsquo;s whereabouts, but managed somehow
to make his way to the army&rsquo;s headquarters at
Falmouth. It had been a long, melancholy journey;
but arrived at the camp, he found his brother already
well again, his wound having healed rapidly.</p>

<p>This sudden journey had momentous consequences
for Whitman. His stay in New York was, perhaps
naturally, drawing to a close. There are indications in
the last poems that he was contemplating a westward
journey, and possibly a settlement beyond the Rockies.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
Although he paid it frequent visits, he never lived again
in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>At Falmouth he found among the wounded a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
of young fellows whom he had known in New York.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> He
took a natural interest in their welfare, and even though
he felt he could do little for them, lingered till a party
going up to Washington offered him an opportunity
for usefulness in their escort. Arriving at the capital,
he found innumerable similar occasions in the many
hospitals which had been established in and about the
city. These he began to visit daily, supporting himself
by writing letters to the New York and Brooklyn press&mdash;to
the <i>New York Times</i> in particular&mdash;and by copying
work in the paymaster&rsquo;s office.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> It was not till two
years later that he obtained regular employment in the
Civil Service; but during the whole of that time he was
paying almost daily visits to the wards, in his honorary
and voluntary capacity, as friend of the wounded.</p>

<p>The number of these was periodically swollen by
great battles. On the 4th of May, 1863, General
Hooker lost the day at Chancellorsville, and was replaced
by Meade. Early in July, Lee made a second
alarming dash into the North, but was turned back by
General Meade from the bloody field of Gettysburg,
where the total losses reached the appalling figure of
60,000.</p>

<p>By this time, more than two years after the fall of
Fort Sumter, the first easy boasting of a short campaign
and an overwhelming triumph, indulged by both sides,
had long died; and the solemn sense of the great
tragedy being enacted before its eyes possessed the
nation. This sentiment could not have been more
nobly expressed than in the words used by the President,
when, speaking at the dedication of a portion of
the Gettysburg battlefield as a national cemetery,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> he
said: &ldquo;We here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall
have a new birth of freedom: and that government of
the people by the people for the people shall not perish
from the earth&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span></p>
<p>Meade&rsquo;s victory, and the news following fast upon it
of Grant&rsquo;s capture of Vicksburg, with the consequent
reopening of the Mississippi, reassured the wavering
faith of many patriots. But the situation was still full
of peril. In this same month&mdash;July, 1863&mdash;there were
serious riots in New York,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> instigated by the &ldquo;Copperheads,&rdquo;
as the Northern sympathisers with the Confederacy
were dubbed, in opposition to the first draft for the
army under the general conscription law of March. In
these, more than a thousand persons were killed or
wounded.</p>

<p>The riots were the more difficult to quell because all
available troops and volunteers had been sent to the
front; and these of course included a great proportion of
the stabler citizens. At the same time the disaffected
elements remained in their full strength. The political
character of the disturbance was plain enough; for the
rioters set upon any negroes they met, slinging them to
the lamp-posts, and would have burned down the hospital,
full of wounded Union soldiers, had they not been prevented.</p>

<p>It is some satisfaction to know that we cannot couple
the name of Fernando Wood with these outrages.
There was something genuine in his patriotism. He
was now in Congress, and had recently been vainly
attempting, in his usual futile fashion, to negotiate a
peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Both the draft and the riots caused the Whitman
family no little anxiety. George, who had entered the
army as a private and was promoted stage by stage till
he became a lieutenant-colonel, was of course already at
the front;<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> and Jeff, who had married four years earlier,
was keeping the home together for the old mother and
helpless youngest son, as well as for his own wife and
their young children. Anything that happened to him
would involve the happiness of the whole family. They
feared especially that he might be drawn for service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
and Walt wrote from Washington that in that event,
he would do all in his power to raise the necessary
money to provide a substitute.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Walt himself never closed his ears against the call
to serve in the ranks, if it should come to him. Had he
himself been drawn, he might have regarded the circumstance
as the intimation of duty; but he was not.
Instead he took the risks of small-pox in the infectious
wards, as well as that which is incurred by the frequent
dressing of gangrened wounds; and he bore the spiritual
burden of all the pathetic war-wreckage which drifted
into Washington month after weary month.</p>

<p>The tension of those days was terrible to him. Devoted
to the &ldquo;Mother of All,&rdquo; the American nation, he
loved her sons both North and South with an equal
affection, their suffering and destruction wringing his
heart. For, mystic as he was, he had all the strong
passions of humanity, and felt to the full the agonies
of the flesh. On the one side also, his own brother was
in the hottest of the fighting throughout these years;
while on the other, it is just possible that some young
son of his own, known or unknown to him, may have
served among the boys in the opposite ranks before the
war was over. His Abolitionist friends would sigh, and
say the struggle must go on till every slave should be
free; but he who valued freedom not less than they, and
understood perhaps better what it really means, dissented
from them.</p>

<p>The first sight of a battlefield made him cry out for
peace; and if in the following months he felt the exhilaration
which breathed from the simple heroism displayed
by the soldiers, he still saw that war is not all heroic,
but in time must darken the fairest cause. The terrible
burden of its inconceivable extravagance began to weigh
upon him like a nightmare. Each new season, with its
prospective train of ambulances, its legion of tragedies,
bewildered him with its horror; till he angrily denied
that the whole population of negroes could be worth so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
terrific a purchase.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> It may have been the exaggerated
retort to an extremist argument; but indeed it was not
for the negroes that the war was being fought; it was
not for the powerful but highly coloured manifesto of
<i>Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin</i>, but for the &ldquo;Declaration of Independence,&rdquo;
and for the Constitution of America. And
this both Whitman and Lincoln realised: they knew the
negro of the South as the New Englander never knew
him, and were firm in demanding for him the rights of a
human being; but they knew also that mere abolition
would not give him these, nor could it render him capable
of the right exercise of American citizenship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though Lee had been thrown back from Gettysburg,
his army had never recognised a defeat; and the chief
danger to the cause of American unity lay in the conviction
of the South that its general and his men were
really invincible. For two more years they kept the
field, with a heroic determination that appears at the
same time little short of criminal when we consider the
conditions involved upon all the parties to resistance.
And when we add to these the story of the Southern
military prisons, even the chivalrous fame of Lee
becomes stained with an ineffaceable shame. Better a
thousand times to have acknowledged defeat than to
have been guilty of enforcing such things. But the
pride of the South had become rigid, and would only
admit defeat after it was broken. Its political leaders
had staked everything upon victory; and it would seem
that they preferred to sacrifice a whole generation of
their supporters and victims rather than bear the
penalty of their failure.</p>

<p>When Grant, or rather the reckless courage of his
American volunteers,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> had crushed General Bragg at
Chattanooga, and his friend Sherman had completed the
work of clearing Tennessee, Lee&rsquo;s army remained the
sole hope of the desperately impoverished South. But
still in itself and in its leader it was absolutely confident.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span></p>
<p>A similar confidence inspired the hearts of the Union
soldiers, when in March, 1864, the downright laconic
general from the West was given supreme command,
and went into Virginia to crush his antagonist by mere
force of numbers and determination.</p>

<p>In Grant at last both Lincoln and the army had
found the man they were waiting for. But still a year
went by before the task was accomplished&mdash;a year whose
memory is the most terrible of the war&mdash;upon whose
page are inscribed such names as, The Wilderness,
Spotsylvania, Bloody Angle, North Anna, Cold Harbour,
recalling those awful fields whereon more than a hundred
thousand soldiers fell. While Grant was stubbornly
pushing Lee back upon Richmond, and finally
holding him there, Sherman was cutting him off from
further support by that extraordinary march south-eastwards
from Chattanooga through <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Atalanta">Atlanta</span> to the
sea. He captured Savannah just before Christmas;
and afterwards turning north, and wading through all
the morasses and crossing all the innumerable streams
and rivers of the Carolinas, he completed his errand a
few days before his chief entered the Southern capital.</p>

<p>Several futile attempts had been made to bring about
a reconciliation between North and South before the
bitter end;<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> but Lincoln, eager as he was for peace, stood
out irrevocably for the acknowledgment of the Union,
and now added to it the emancipation of the slaves. It
was clear that nothing short of Lee&rsquo;s capitulation could
satisfy the country or end the war. On the 3rd April,
Richmond surrendered to Grant; and on the day after,
the President, who was then with the army, entered the
city which the evacuating forces had fired. Five more
days and Lee gave himself up: by the end of the month
the surrender of the Confederate troops had been effected,
while Jefferson Davis was captured in Georgia on the
10th of May. A fortnight later the combined hosts of
Grant and Sherman passed before the President in a last
grand review along Pennsylvania Avenue and before the
White House, to be thereafter disbanded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span></p>
<p>But the President was no longer Abraham Lincoln.
Re-elected in the preceding autumn, in spite of Republican
intrigues and the dangerous opposition of General
McClellan, who was put forward by the Democrats,
Lincoln had been assassinated during a performance at
Ford&rsquo;s Theatre, on the evening of the 14th of April, the
fourth anniversary of the fall of Fort Sumter.</p>

<p>The loss to his country was irreparable. More than
any other of its Presidents, either before or since, Abraham
Lincoln embodied the real genius of the American
nation, and in the hour of their agony he was the father
of his people. Slowly they had learnt his strength and
his wisdom; but they had hardly begun to understand
the greatness of a heart which was able to love the
South with a mother&rsquo;s tenderness even while it was
in arms against him.</p>

<p>The Vice-President, who stepped into his place, was
a Union Democrat; he also loved the South, but less
wisely than well. His rash haste in the reconstruction
of the governments of the defeated States threw the
nation into the hands of the group of narrowly partisan
Republicans which continued to rule America with unscrupulous
ability and ill-concealed self-interest<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> for
sixteen years, threatening by its attitude towards the
Southern people to alienate their sympathies forever
from the Union.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center">THE PROOF OF COMRADESHIP</p>


<p class="p2">Whitman&rsquo;s residence in Washington and the
nature of his occupation in the hospitals,
through the years of the war, have rendered an outline
of their history almost necessary. Of his manner of life
during this period we have many notes and records, both
in his own letters and memoranda and in the biographical
accounts afterwards printed by his friends.</p>

<p>During the first five or six months after his arrival he
took his meals and spent much of his spare time with
Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor, who had recently settled in the
city.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> He boarded in the same house as they, about
six blocks from the Treasury building, where O&rsquo;Connor
worked, and a mile from the Armory Square Hospital,
where lay many of his own wounded friends.</p>

<p>William Douglas O&rsquo;Connor was a strikingly handsome
man of thirty years, full of spirit and eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
He had previously been a Boston journalist, had married
in that city a charming wife, and was the father of two
children. He had lost his post there through his outspoken
support of John Brown and the attack on
Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. While out of employment he had
written his novel, <i>Harrington</i>, an eloquent story of the
Abolitionist cause, which was published by Thayer &amp;
Eldridge. In 1861 he had obtained a comfortable clerkship
in the Lighthouse Bureau under the new Lincoln
administration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/i190.jpg" width="525" height="800" alt="Picture of William Douglas O'Connor." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WILLIAM DOUGLAS O&rsquo;CONNOR</p></div>
</div>

<p>Whitman had already made his acquaintance in Bos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>ton,
and their friendship now became most cordial and
intimate. Generous and romantic in his view of life,
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s whole personality was very attractive to
Whitman from the day of their first encounter. He had
the warm Irish temperament which Walt loved; he was
a natural actor, and Walt was always at home with
actors.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Moreover, he was an eager and intelligent
admirer of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>; and his keen insight, wide
reading and remarkable powers of elocution sometimes
revealed to their author meanings and suggestions in
his own familiar words of which he himself had been
unconscious. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s personal attachment to and
reverence for the older man is evident upon every page
of <i>The Carpenter</i>, a tale which he afterwards contributed
to <i>Putnam&rsquo;s Magazine</i>;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> while in the impassioned
eulogium of <i>The Good Gray Poet</i> he has expressed his
admiration for the <i>Leaves</i>.</p>

<p>Upon politics however the two friends never agreed,
and, unfortunately, O&rsquo;Connor was always eager for political
argument. He was a friend of Wendell Phillips,
that anti-slavery orator who once described Lincoln as
&ldquo;the slave-hound of Illinois,&rdquo; because the latter approved
the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law while it
remained on the statute-book: and to O&rsquo;Connor, compulsory
emancipation always came before the preservation
of the Union. This of course was not Whitman&rsquo;s
view, and it was upon the negro question that their
friendship finally suffered shipwreck.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s rooms soon became the centre of an interesting
group of literary friends. Mr. Eldridge, the
publisher,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> came to Washington after the wreck of his
Boston business, and a little later Mr. John Burroughs,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
a student of Wordsworth, Emerson and the <i>Leaves</i>,
being attracted to the capital, whither all eyes were
turning, gave up teaching in New England, and obtained
a Government clerkship. Mr. E. C. Steadman,<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
a poet and journalist in those days, and a clerk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
Attorney-General&rsquo;s department, was of the O&rsquo;Connor
group; and Mr. Hubley Ashton<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> also, then a rising
young lawyer, who afterwards intervened successfully
on Whitman&rsquo;s behalf at a critical moment.</p>

<p>The last-named of these gentlemen tells me that he
first saw Whitman late one evening at the rooms of
their mutual friend. It was indeed past midnight when
Walt appeared asking for supper. He was wearing
army boots, his sleeves were rolled up, and his coat was
slung across his arm. He had just come in with a
train-load of wounded from the front, and had been
disposing of his charges in the Washington hospitals.
Very picturesque he looked, as he stood there, stalwart,
unconventional, majestic, an heroic American figure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That figure rapidly became as familiar in Washington
as it had been in New York.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> No one could miss or
mistake this great jolly-looking man, with his deliberate
but swinging gait, his red face with its grey beard over
the open collar, and crowned by the big slouch hat; and
every one wondered who and what he might be. Some
Western general, or sea-captain, or perhaps a Catholic
Father, they would guess;<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> for he seemed a leader of
men, and there was a freshness about his presence that
surely must have come either from the prairies, the
great deep, or the very heart of humanity. He had
the bearing, too, of a man of action; he looked as
though he could handle the ribbons, or swing an axe
with the best, as indeed he could.</p>

<p>Whitman was more puzzled than any of the onlookers
about his occupation, or rather his business. Occupation
he never lacked while the hospitals were full; but
for years he was very poor, and once, at least, seriously
in debt.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The need for money, to supply the little
extras which might save the life of many a poor fellow
in the wards, was constant; and now, probably for the
first time, he found it difficult to earn his own liveli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>hood.
He had failed in his application for a Government
clerkship. Living in Washington was in itself
costly, and the paragraphs and letters which he contributed
to the local and metropolitan press, with his
two or three hours a day of copying in the paymaster&rsquo;s
office&mdash;a pleasant top-room overlooking the city and
the river&mdash;brought him but a meagre income.</p>

<p>Moreover the need for money began to press in a new
direction; for first, the family breadwinner at Brooklyn
was threatened, and then, though he was not drawn for
the army, his salary was cut in two.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Whereupon
brother Andrew, always one suspects rather a poor tool,
fell ill; and died after a lingering malady,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> leaving a
widow and several little children in poverty.</p>

<p>Walt himself lived in the strictest simplicity. For
awhile, as we have seen, he boarded with the O&rsquo;Connors;
then he took a little room on a top-floor;<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> breakfasted
on tea and bread, toasted before an oil-stove, and had
for his one solid meal a shilling dinner at a cheap
restaurant. To all appearance he was in magnificent
health. At the beginning of the first summer he is so
large and well, as he playfully tells his mother, that he
looks &ldquo;like a great wild buffalo, with much hair&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Simplicity of life was never a hardship to him. There
was something wild and elemental in his nature that
chose a den rather than a parlour or a club-room for
its shelter.</p>

<p>The money difficulty renewed his thoughts of lecturing,
and after the first summer in Washington his
home&mdash;letters often refer to it.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> But the plan now
appears less as an apostolate than as a means of raising
funds for his hospital service. The change may, of
course, be due in part to the fact that he was writing of
his plans to his old mother, who would be most likely
to appreciate this motive; but it was chiefly the result
of his present complete absorption in those immediate
tasks of comradeship for which he seemed to be born.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span></p>
<p>He was, however, well advised not to actually attempt
the enterprise. Even a famous orator could hardly
have found a hearing during the crisis of the war, when
the newspaper with its casualty lists was almost the
sole centre of interest. And even had he been sure of
success, his hospital service would not have let him
go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During this first summer Whitman hurt his hand,
and had to avoid some of the worst cases in order to
escape blood-poisoning;<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> but in September he wrote
home: &ldquo;I am first-rate in health, so much better than
a month or two ago: my hand has entirely healed. I
go to hospital every day or night. I believe no men
ever loved each other as I and some of these poor
wounded sick and dying men love each other.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> Such
words are a fitting commentary upon the pages of
Calamus. Here, among the perishing, the genius of
this great comrade of young men found its proper work
of redemption.</p>

<p>Great, indeed, was his opportunity. The federal city
was full of troops and of wounded soldiers. The whole
of the district a few blocks north of Pennsylvania
Avenue, and of that lying east of the Capitol, were alike
occupied by parade grounds, camps and hospitals. The
latter even invaded the Capitol itself; and for a time
the present Hall of Statuary was used as a ward.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
Midway between the Capitol and the present Washington
Monument, and close to the Baltimore and Potomac
railway station, is the site of the Armory Square Hospital;
four blocks to the north again is the Patent
Office, for a long time filled with beds. And hard by,
in Judiciary Square, where the hideous Pension Office
now stands, was another great camp of the &ldquo;boys in
white&rdquo;. Whitman was a frequent visitor at all of these.</p>

<p>There were fourteen large hospitals in the city by
the summer of 1863; and the total number in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
about it rose to fifty. They spread away over the surrounding
fields and hill-sides, as far as the Fairfax
Seminary<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> on the ridge above the quaint Washingtonian
town of Alexandria. This was almost in the enemy&rsquo;s
country. And even the melancholy strains of the Dead
March were welcomed with covert rejoicings by its
citizens when the funeral of some Union soldier passed
their doors.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> All through the war Washington itself was
full of disaffected persons; and for a while, looking out
from the height of the Capitol, one could see the Confederate
flag flying on the Virginian hills opposite.</p>

<p>The greater part of the hospital nursing was done, of
course, by orderlies; and a more or less severe and
mechanical officialism prevailed in most of the wards.
But this frigid atmosphere was warmed by the presence
of a number of women; emissaries of Relief Associations
supported by individual States, or of the Sanitary and
Christian Commissions. It is difficult to overestimate
the good that was done by Dorothea Dix and her
helpers, among whom were not a few Quakeresses;
and by all the devoted Sisters of Mercy and Sisters of
Charity whose goodwill never failed.</p>

<p>But even then the field for service was so vast that
much remained undone. Many of the doctors and
surgeons were able and kindly, some of them were
absolutely devoted to their painful labours; and many
of the nurses were more than patient and faithful; but
the lads who were carried in wounded and sick from
the cold and ghastly fields, wanted the strong support
of manly understanding and prodigal affection in fuller
measure than mere humanity seemed able to give.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
Human as he was, Walt came to hundreds, perhaps
thousands of them, like a Saviour. In after years they
remembered &ldquo;a man with the face of an angel&rdquo; who
had devoted himself to their individual needs.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The mere presence of a perfectly sane and radiant
personality raised the tone of a whole ward.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The dead-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>weight
of cloudy depression brooding upon it would
melt in the ineffable sunshine that streamed from him.
And then he always seemed to know exactly what was
wanted, and he was never in a hurry. When anything
was to be done or altered, he spoke with the authority
of the man who alone, among overpressed and busy
people, has the leisure for personal investigation; and
therefore in most cases he had his way.</p>

<p>Absolutely unsparing of himself, he knew too well
wherein his strength lay to be careless of his health.
If his food was sometimes insufficient, he would yet
take his one square meal,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> after refreshing himself with
a bath, before starting upon his rounds. And when
they were over, he cleared his brain under the stars
before he turned in to sleep. Thus he kept his power
at the full, and his presence was like that of the open
air. He would often come into the wards carrying wild
flowers newly picked, and strewing them over the beds,
like a herald of the summer. Well did he know that
they were messengers of life to the sick, words to them
from the Earth-mother of men.</p>

<p>Whatever he might be in the literary world of Washington
or New York, here Whitman was nothing but
Walt the comrade of soldiers. And for himself, he said
in later years, that the supreme loves of his life had
been for his mother and for the wounded.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> It is a saying
worthy of remembrance, for it indicates the man.</p>

<p>Of the efficiency of his service there can be no question.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
He worked his own miracles. He knew it positively
himself, and besides, both the lads and the doctors
assured him, time and again, that he was saving lives
by refusing to give them over to despair. &ldquo;I can testify,&rdquo;
he writes to <i>The Brooklyn Eagle</i>, his old paper, &ldquo;that
friendship has literally cured a fever, and the medicine
of daily affection a bad wound.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> In his own words,
he distributed himself,<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> as well as the contents of his
pockets and haversack, in infinitesimal quantities, cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>tain
that but little of his giving would be wasted. And
yet he never gave indiscriminately;<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> he knew always
what he was doing, and did it with deliberation.</p>

<p>The feeling that the lads wanted him had detained
him at the first; the superabundance of his life,
and the fulness of his health and spirits, carrying with
them a conviction of duty when he entered these vestibules
of death.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Here was something that he, and he
only, could adequately accomplish; here was a cry he
was bound by the law of his being to answer; and the
cry of the hospitals continued to hold him till the war
was done. As he left of a night, after going his last
round and kissing many a young, pale, bearded face, in
fulfilment of his own written injunctions, he would hear
the boys calling, &ldquo;Walt, Walt, Walt! come again, come
again!&rdquo; And it would have required a harder heart
than his to refuse them, even had the answer within
been less loud and insistent.</p>

<p>They kept him busy, too. He provided them with
pens, stamps, envelopes and paper, and wrote their
letters for them;<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> letters to mothers, wives and sweethearts;
and the last news of all, when the sad procession
had carried son, husband or lover to his soldier&rsquo;s grave,
and had fired over him the last salute. He would enter,
armed with newspapers and magazines which he distributed;
and often he would read to the men, or recite
some suitable verses, never, I think, his own.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> He
played games with them, too; and though he was one of
the few men in Washington who never smoked,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> he was
the only one of all the visitors who brought them tobacco;
and the ward-surgeons, though at first they
protested, could not refuse him; it really seemed as
though Walt knew best. On the glorious Fourth, he
would provide a feast of ice-cream for some ward;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and
on other hot days&mdash;and there were too many in the
capital&mdash;would distribute the contents of crates full of
oranges,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> or lemons and sugar for the making of lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>It was for such gifts as these, and many others of a
similar kind, that he needed money; and through the
influence of Emerson, James Redpath and other friends
in New York and Boston, he was able to distribute perhaps
£1,200 among the soldiers in these infinitesimal
quantities.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Thus he became the almoner of many in
the North.</p>

<p>Much of the service, however, was entirely his own&mdash;if
one can ever call love one&rsquo;s own, which all things
seem to offer to the soul that has learnt to receive from
all. In cases of heart sickness, and the despondency
and despair that come to the lonely man lying helpless
among callous or unimaginative and therefore indifferent
persons, Walt&rsquo;s quick divination of the real trouble
made him the best of nurses; and he took care to
remember all the cases that came under his notice,
innumerable as they must have seemed.</p>

<p>He kept a strict record of his patients and their
individual needs in little blood and tear-stained notebooks,
many of which are still extant.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> This is an
additional proof of that concrete definiteness of observation
which distinguishes his habit of mind from the
love of merely nebulous generalisation of which he is
sometimes accused. One is bound to respect the intuitions
of a mind which has so large a grasp of detail.</p>

<p>Beginning characteristically with the Brooklyn lads
whom he found scattered about the several hospitals,
and who claimed his attention by the natural right of
old acquaintanceship, his work grew like a rolling snowball,
as he made his way from bed to bed; for he was
always quick to feel the needs of a stranger. Before
long he realised that there was not one among the
thousand tents and wards in which he might not profitably
have expended his whole vital energy. As it
was, however, he tramped from hospital to hospital,
faithfully going his rounds as far afield as the Fairfax
Seminary. And in those days the Washington streets
were heavy walking in the wet weather; for Pennsyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>vania
Avenue was the only one that was yet paved,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and
then boasted nothing but the cobble-stones, which still
serve in the quaint streets across the Potomac.</p>

<p>He walked a great deal. The open air relieved the
tension of the wards, which at times was almost unbearable.
Though his presence and affection saved
many a lad&rsquo;s life, there must have been many more
that died; and the tragedy of these deaths, and the
terrible suffering that often preceded them, bit into his
soul.</p>

<p>Fascinated though he was by his employment, and
delighting in it while he was strong and well,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> the
strength of his great heart was often as helpless as a
little child&rsquo;s; and his whole nature staggered under the
blows, which he felt even in his physical frame. He
was literally an &ldquo;amateur&rdquo;; he could never take a
detached or &ldquo;professional&rdquo; attitude towards his patients,
for he knew that what they needed from him was love;
their suffering became his suffering, and something died
in him when they died.</p>

<p>The following passage, written when the war itself
was drawing to a close, indicates the character of much
of his work, and the spirit in which it was done:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The large ward I am in is used for secession soldiers
exclusively. One man, about forty years of age,
emaciated with diarrh&oelig;a, I was attracted to, as he lay
with his eyes turned up, looking like death. His weakness
was so extreme that it took a minute or so every
time for him to talk with anything like consecutive
meaning; yet he was evidently a man of good intelligence
and education. As I said anything, he would lie
a moment perfectly still, then, with closed eyes, answer
in a low, very slow voice, quite correct and sensible, but
in a way and tone that wrung my heart. He had a
mother, wife and child, living (or probably living) in his
home in Mississippi. It was long, long since he had
seen them. Had he caused a letter to be sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
since he got here in Washington? No answer. I repeated
the question very slowly and soothingly. He
could not tell whether he had or not&mdash;things of late
seemed to him like a dream. After waiting a moment,
I said: &lsquo;Well, I am going to walk down the ward a
moment, and when I come back you can tell me. If
you have not written, I will sit down and write.&rsquo; A
few minutes after I returned; he said he remembered
now that some one had written for him two or three
days before. The presence of this man impressed me
profoundly. The flesh was all sunken on face and
arms; the eyes low in their sockets and glassy, and
with purple rings around them. Two or three great
tears silently flowed out from the eyes, and rolled down
his temples (he was doubtless unused to be spoken to
as I was speaking to him). Sickness, imprisonment,
exhaustion, etc., had conquered the body, yet the mind
held mastery still, and called even wandering remembrance
back.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>At times the tragedy unnerved him, so that even his
native optimism was clouded. &ldquo;I believe there is not
much but trouble in this world,&rdquo; we find him writing to
his mother, and the page hardly reads like one of his;
&ldquo;if one hasn&rsquo;t any for himself, he has it made up by
having it brought close to him through others, and that
is sometimes worse than to have it touch oneself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
He had already learnt the primer of sorrow; now he
was studying the lore in which he was to become so
deeply read.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even that first summer the malarial climate and excessive
heat of Washington, with the close watching in
the wards, and the continual draught upon his vital
forces, affected him perceptibly. In his letters home he
mentions heavy colds, with deafness and trouble in his
head caused by the awful heat,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> as giving him some
anxiety. He seems to have had a slight sun-stroke in
earlier years, which made him more susceptible to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
kind of weakness; and on hot days he went armed with
a big umbrella and a fan.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> But through all this time
he seemed to his friends the very incarnation of his
&ldquo;robust soul&rdquo;.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i201.jpg" width="600" height="791" alt="Picture of John Burroughs at sixty-three." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN BURROUGHS AT SIXTY-THREE</p></div>
</div>

<p>Though he shuddered sometimes as he recalled the
sights of the wards, the life outside was a pleasant one.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
He loved to take long midnight rambles about the city
and over the surrounding hills, with his friends. In
spring, he delighted in the bird-song, the colour and
fragrance of the flowers which lined the banks of Rock
Creek,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> a stream which, entering the broad Potomac a
mile above the Treasury building, separated Washington
from the narrow ivy-clad streets of suburban Georgetown.</p>

<p>And the stir and life of the capital always interested
him. He loved to watch the marching of the troops;
and the martial music and flying colours always delighted
him as though he were a boy. He frequently
met the President,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> blanched and worn with anxiety
and sorrow, riding in from his breezier lodging at the
Soldiers&rsquo; Home on the north side of the city, to his
official residence. They would exchange the salutations
of street acquaintances, each man admiring the patent
manliness of the other.</p>

<p>In Washington, as in New York, Whitman was
speedily making himself at home with everybody;
eating melons in the street with a countryman,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> or
chatting at the Capitol with a member of Congress; for
men or women, black or white, he always had his own
friendly word. He had besides, as we have seen, his
inner circle at O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was often at the Capitol, that noble, but somewhat
uninteresting building which overlooks the city;
and if he deplored the low level of the Congressional
debates, he found some compensation among the trees
without; for fine trees were already a feature of Washington,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
which now appears, as one looks down upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
like a city builded in a wood. About sundown, too, he
liked to stand where he could see the level light blazing
like a star upon the bronze figure of Liberty, newly
mounted above the dome.</p>

<p>It was in the summer of 1864, when Whitman was
forty-five years of age, that he had his first serious
illness. He had never been really out of health before.
The preceding autumn he had paid a short visit to his
home, and in February had gone down to the front at
Culpepper, thinking that his services might be needed
nearer to the actual scene of battle. But he found
that he could do better work in Washington. The cases
there seemed to grow more desperate as the long strain
of the war made itself felt upon the men in the ranks.</p>

<p>It was immediately after this that Grant was given
the supreme command; and at the close of March,
Whitman, who foresaw the real meaning of the task of
crushing Lee, wrote of it thus: &ldquo;O mother, to think
that we are to have here soon what I have seen so
many times; the awful loads and trains and boat-loads
of poor, bloody and pale, and wounded young men
again.... I see all the little signs&mdash;getting ready in
the hospitals, etc. It is dreadful when one thinks about
it. I sometimes think over the sights I have myself
seen: the arrival of the wounded after a battle; and
the scenes on the field too; and I can hardly believe
my own recollections. What an awful thing war is!
Mother, it seems not men, but a lot of devils and
butchers, butchering one another.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>A week later, describing the frightful sufferings of the
soldiers, and the callous selfishness of their attendants,
he says: &ldquo;I get almost frightened at the world&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
Again, two days after: &ldquo;I have been in the midst of
suffering and death for two months, worse than ever.
The only comfort is that I have been the cause of some
beams of sunshine upon their suffering and gloomy
souls and bodies too.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> And he adds: &ldquo;Oh, it is
terrible, and getting worse, worse, worse&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Rumours spread in the city of the probable character
of Grant&rsquo;s campaign; and as he realised more and more
fully what would be its inevitable cost, a sort of terror
took hold of him. Yet he believed in Grant, as well as
in Lincoln.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> And hating war as he did, he could not
see any other course possible now than to complete its
work. He was solemnly ready to take his part in those
ranks of men converted, as it were, into &ldquo;devils and
butchers,&rdquo; if need be, if he could feel assured that he
was more use to America upon the field than in the
wards among the sick and dying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he shared the old mother&rsquo;s anxiety about
George, who was always in the thick of the fighting.
News, both true and false, was arriving; and his letters
are always seeking to support the old woman&rsquo;s faith,
and to give her the plain truth with all the hope that
might be.</p>

<p>He was kept very closely occupied now in the hospitals;
and especially at Armory Square, where some
200 desperate cases were collected;<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> men who had lain
on the field, or otherwise unattended, until their wounds
and amputations had mortified. He had always made
a rule of going where he was most needed. But now
he began to suffer severely from what he describes as
fulness in the head, to have fits of faintness, and to be
troubled with sore throat.</p>

<p>To add to the horrors of those days, a number of the
wounded lads went crazy; and at last the strain became
so manifestly too much for his failing vitality,
that his friends and the doctors bade him go North for
a time. But he hung on still; hoping, like Grant, for
the war to end with the summer, and writing to his
mother that he cannot bear to leave and be absent
if George should be hit and brought into Washington.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
However, with midsummer upon him and its deadly
heat, he became really ill, and had to relinquish his
post. For nearly six months he remained restlessly
at home.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span></p>
<p>Whitman never fully recovered. We may perhaps
be surprised at this, and wonder that he should have
broken down, even under the circumstances. Was he
not in such relations with the Universal Life that he
should daily have been able to replenish the storehouse
of his physical and emotional forces?</p>

<p>He was no spendthrift, and husbanded them as well
as he might, knowing their value; and doubtless he
asked himself this very question many a time. Doubtless,
too, he was confident, at least during the earlier
months, that after the strain was over his resilient
nature would regain its normal tone. But on the other
hand, he had volunteered for a service to whose claims
he was ready to respond to the uttermost farthing.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
Where others gave their lives, who was he to hold back
anything of his?</p>

<p>The soul, one may say, never gives more than it can
afford; for the soul is divinely prudent, and knows the
worthlessness of such a gift. And giving with that
prudence, it never seeks repayment; what it gives, it
gives. But the body, even at its best, is not as the
soul. And when the soul gives the vital and emotional
forces of its body to invigorate other bodies, it may give
more of these, and more continuously, than the body
can replace. And so it was with Whitman. He gave,
and I think he gave deliberately, for he was an extraordinarily
deliberate man, that for which he cared far

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">A WASHINGTON CLERK</p>


<p class="p2">While Whitman was at home, during the latter
part of 1864, he doubtless put the finishing
touches to <i>Drum-taps</i>, which was printed at New
York early in the following summer. Several of the
poems in this collection had been written in that city
during the two years which had elapsed since the last
publication of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, before he set out for
Washington. The manuscript had remained at home,
tied up in its square, spotted, stone-colour covers,<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> but
was sent on to him, to be discussed in the Washington
circle. Early in 1864 a friend seems to have taken it
the round of the Boston publishers, but without success.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>If we are to understand Whitman&rsquo;s attitude towards
the war, we must glance at the little brown volume of
seventy-two pages, <i>Walt Whitman&rsquo;s Drum-taps</i>. Among
the poems which preceded his visit to the capital were
probably the song of &ldquo;Pioneers,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> with its cry of the
West, and the poem of the &ldquo;Broadway Pageant,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> of
1860, celebrating the Japanese Embassy, and forming a
complementary tribute to the maternal East. To these
one may add the lines to &ldquo;Old Ireland&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> and the noble
&ldquo;Years of the Modern&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>In this last he proclaims the growing consciousness
of solidarity among the peoples of the world. Artificial
boundaries seem to be breaking down in Europe, and
the people are making their own landmarks&mdash;witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
the rise of a new Italy. Everywhere men among the
people are awaking to ask pregnant questions, and to
link all lands together with steam and electricity.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The war poems follow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s attitude towards war is not obvious, but
it is, I believe, logical and consistent. On one side it
approximated to the Quaker position, but only on one
side. Or rather, perhaps, the Quaker position approximates
to one side of Whitman&rsquo;s. He was devoted to a
social order, or republic, which could not be realised by
deeds of arms. He had no hatred for any of his fellows,
and recognised in his political enemy a man divine
as himself&mdash;one cannot say that he had any personal
enemies, though there were men who would like to
have been accounted such.</p>

<p>The fat years of peace had, however, awakened doubts
in him of the average American&rsquo;s capacity for great
passions.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> These seemed to be rare among them, and
Whitman had been driven to seek them in nature and
her storms. It was with exultation, then, that he felt
the response of New York and of the whole of America
to the call of the trumpet.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>Men of peace are accustomed to lament the contagion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
of the war-fever, and with a large measure of justice.
But so long as civilisation tends to render the common
lives of men cheap or calculating, there will remain a
divine necessity for those hours of fierce enthusiasm
which, like a forest fire or religious revival, sweep irresistibly
over a nation. Whitman shared the rhythmic
answer of the blood, and of the soul which is involved
therewith, to the imperious throbbing of the drums.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
He knew that it represented in some, perhaps barbaric,
way the throbbing of the nation&rsquo;s heart, and that the
cry &ldquo;To Arms!&rdquo; called forth much that was best in
men.</p>

<p>The call to arms is one thing; the actual fighting,
which converts men, to use his own phrase, into
&ldquo;devils and butchers,&rdquo; is another. The call to arms
awakes something in a man more heroic than the life
he ordinarily lives; he seems to hear in it the voice of
the Nation calling him by name, and when he answers
he feels the joy of the Nation in his heart. He becomes
consciously one with a great host in the hour of peril.
He hears the voice of a Cause in the bugles and the
drums. He shares in a new emotion, which is his glory
because it is not his alone. He finds a fuller liberty
than he has ever known in the discipline of the ranks;
he accepts the petty tyrannies to which he is subjected,
feeling that behind the officers is the will of the Nation
to which he has yielded his own.</p>

<p>This, for better and worse, we may call the mysticism
of war, and it appealed forcibly to Whitman. For him,
war was illuminated by the idea of solidarity; an idea
which was constantly present to him from this time
forward. He no longer saw the great personalities
only, nor only their divine comradeship in the life of
God; all that remained as vivid as of old; but now
he was being constantly reminded of the way in which
individuals share consciously in the life of the nation;
and this suggested to him how, presently, they will come
to be conscious of their part in the life of the Race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>He recognised how essential was the sense of citizenship
to fuller soul-life. The barriers in which our individual
lives are isolated must be broken, if liberty is
to be brought to the soul. If we are to live fully, we
must feel the tides of being sweep through our emotional
natures. Hence his welcome to war, which, in spite of
all the fiendish spirits which follow in its wake, does
thrill a chord of national consciousness in the individual
heart.</p>

<p>We may well ask whether there is no errand worthier
of this sense of solidarity than that of slaughter. Surely
the affirmation of such an errand underlies the whole
thought of <i>Drum-taps</i>, with its call to a &ldquo;divine war&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>The hour has come when the Social Passion is about
to rouse the peoples to a nobler crusade against oppression
than any yet; when the nations shall be purged
by revolutions wholesomer than those of 1789 or 1861.
Whitman&rsquo;s whole life, throbbing in every page he wrote,
proclaims it.</p>

<p>He regarded the Civil War as a sort of fever in the
body politic, caused by anterior conditions of congestion.
War had become necessary for the life of that
body, and only after a war could health re-assert itself.
To compromise continually, as we boast in England
that we do, may sustain a sort of social peace, but it is
almost certain to drive the disease deeper into the very
heart of our national life, and there to sap the sheer
ability for any kind of noble enthusiasm. You may
purchase a sort of peace with the price of a life more
sacred than even that of individual citizens. Whitman
demanded national health, without which he could see
no real peace.</p>

<p>He did not suppose, indeed, that war could of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
effect a cure. Health could only return in so far as the
aroused conscience of the nation&mdash;which had lived in its
soldiers and in the wives and families who had shared
in their devotion&mdash;was carried forward into the civil life.
Peace itself must be rendered sentient of that heroic
national purpose which had for a moment flashed across
the fields of battle.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Peace, indeed, is only priceless
when it has become more truly and wisely heroical
than war; when it has become affirmative where war is
cruelly negative; when it creates where war destroys,
quickening the heart of each citizen to fulfil a sacred
duty.</p>

<p>Whitman well knew that in order to have such a
peace we must set before the peoples a mission, a
sublime national task. What party is there to-day,
either in England or America, which dares to hold up
for achievement any programme of heroism?</p>

<p>Read in this light, and only so, I believe, will <i>Drum-taps</i>
yield up its essential meaning. It is a Song of the
Broad-axe, not a scream of the war-eagle.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In alluding to <i>Drum-taps</i>, I have somewhat anticipated
the natural course of the story, to which we must now
return. Even at home on furlough, Whitman could not
wholly relinquish the occupation which he had assumed,
and became a frequent visitor at the hospitals of Brooklyn
and New York.</p>

<p>Early in December, 1864, he was back again at his
post, suffering from the added anxiety for his brother&rsquo;s
welfare; for George was a prisoner in the hands of the
Confederates, enduring the almost inconceivable horrors
of a winter imprisonment at Dannville. At the beginning
of February Walt made an application to General Grant,
through a friend in the office of the <i>New York Times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> for
the release of his brother, together with another officer
of the 51st New York Volunteers; alleging, as an urgent
reason, the deep distress of his aged mother whose health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
was breaking. The application appears to have been
successful, and George, who had been captured early in
the preceding summer, and upon whom fever, starvation,
exposure and cold had wreaked their worst for
many months, returned alive to Brooklyn, his excellent
constitution triumphant over all hardships.</p>

<p>In the same month Whitman obtained a clerkship in
the Indian Bureau of the Department of the Interior,
and thoroughly enjoyed the contact into which he was
thus brought with the aboriginal Americans. They on
their side appear to have distinguished him as a real
man among the host of colourless officials, and to have
responded to his advances.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>This was the early spring of Lincoln&rsquo;s death; and
Walt was at the President&rsquo;s last levee.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> He looked in
also at the Inauguration Ball held in the Patent Office&mdash;strangely
converted from its recent uses as a hospital.
There he remarked the worn and weary expression of
the beloved brown face; for still the great tragedy
dragged on.</p>

<p>Five or six weeks later, a young Irish-Virginian, one
of Walt&rsquo;s Washington friends,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> was up in the second
gallery of the crowded theatre upon the tragic night of
the assassination, and saw the whole action passing
before his bewildered eyes. Whitman was at home
again in Brooklyn: seeing George, we may presume,
and making final arrangements for his <i>Drum-taps</i>; on
his return he seems to have heard the whole graphic
story from his friend.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether Whitman and the dead President
had ever spoken to one another, beyond the ordinary
greeting of street acquaintances. They had met perhaps
a score of times, and it is recorded that once, when Walt
passed the President&rsquo;s window, Lincoln had remarked
significantly&mdash;&ldquo;Well, <i>he</i> looks like a man&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> It seems
possible that at first Whitman may have felt something
of the public uncertainty about the character of the new
President.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>How deep-rooted in the average American mind was
the distrust or dislike of his policy is seen in the fact
that, only six months before the death that was mourned
by the whole nation, the opposition to his re-election
was represented by a formidable popular vote. The
South was in revolt, and therefore of course disfranchised;
but even so, McClellan polled as large a total
as had the President at the previous election; though
Lincoln himself increased his former vote by a little
more than one-fifth. So strong ran popular feeling
against the whole policy of interference with the seceding
States even in the fourth year of the war.</p>

<p>But Lincoln&rsquo;s death revealed his true worth to
America. And the sense of the almost sacramental
nature of that death, as sealing for ever the million
others of the war, and finally consecrating the re-established
union of North and South, grew upon
Whitman, who long before had realised that Lincoln
was the father of his country and the captain of her
course.</p>

<p>A sense of some impending tragedy seems to have
accompanied Whitman upon his walks at the time of
the assassination. It was early spring and the lilac
was in blossom; a strange association, deeper than
mere fancy,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> seemed to the poet to establish itself
between the scent of the lilac, the solitary night-song
of the hermit-thrush, the fulness of the evening star at
this time, and the passing of &ldquo;the sweetest, wisest soul
of all my days and lands&rdquo;. It was out of this deeply
realised association that he built up the mystical symphony
which he afterwards called &ldquo;President Lincoln&rsquo;s
Burial Hymn,&rdquo; a poem in many respects similar to his
other great chant of death, &ldquo;Out of the Cradle&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mystical and symbolic, it is charged with a vast
national emotion; and this gives a certain vagueness
to its solemnity, better befitting its theme than a more
concrete treatment. The poet was not writing of &ldquo;him
I love,&rdquo; but rather attempting to express the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
lonely loss which thousands experienced on that dark
April day. Hence his poem is the hymn of a nation&rsquo;s
bereavement rather than the elegy of a great man dead.
Whitman, in his attitude toward Lincoln, had come to
regard him as an incarnation of America. He thought
of him as he thought of the Flag; and his personal
reverence for the man took almost the form of devotion
to an ideal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The President&rsquo;s death had been already noted in
<i>Drum-taps</i>, but when he conceived the longer poem,
Whitman seems to have recalled the edition,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> in order
to add this and certain other verses as a sequel, thus
delaying its publication till about the end of the year.</p>

<p>Another of the new poems calls for a word in passing.
&ldquo;Chanting the Square Deific&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> is an attempt to express
his theory of ultimate reality, that is to say, of the soul.
Four elements go to the making of this, and these he
calls respectively, Jehovah, Christ, Satan and Santa
Spirita&mdash;adopting, as he sometimes would, a formula
of his own inventing, that was of no known language.
In other words, he conceived of the soul&rsquo;s reality,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> as
characterised by four essential qualities; first, its obedience
to the remorseless general laws of being; second,
its capacity for attraction to and absorption into others&mdash;its
love-quality; third, its lawless defiance of everything
but its own will; fourth, its sense of identity with the
whole.</p>

<p>Condemnation, compassion, defiance, harmony, these
he says are final and essential qualities of the Divine;
only as they are united can our idea of God or of the
Soul, which is the Son of God, be complete. In the
traditional Satan of revolt and pride, he saw an element
without which the harmony was immaterial and unreal.
Evil and perilous in itself, in its relation to the rest it
is the solid ballast of the soaring soul. In this, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
suggests much of the attitude which Nietzsche was
afterwards to make his own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the composition of some of these poems a
crisis occurred in his new official career. The war was
over, but the hospitals still were full, and Walt was busy
there as usual in his leisure hours; and at his desk in
the Indian Bureau, whenever his duties were not pressing,
he was at work upon his manuscripts,<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> when some
hostile fellow-clerk seems to have called the attention
of the newly appointed chief of the department to the
character of these private documents.</p>

<p>Whitman had been a favourite with the chief clerk
in the bureau, and had been given a good deal of latitude;
perhaps the hostile person had observed this
with a jealous eye. The manuscript proved to be not
the innocuous <i>Drum-taps</i>, but an annotated copy of
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> preparing for a new edition. A reading
of the volume decided the chief upon a prompt dismissal
of its author, and this is not surprising when we remember
that Mr. Harlan had been appointed through the
pressure of the powerful Methodist interest which he
commanded. The Methodist eye in him must have
regarded many of these pages with suspicion and not a
few with disgust.</p>

<p>The dismissal itself was perfectly colourless; it ran:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Department of the Interior</span>,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, <i>June 30th, 1865</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The services of Walter Whitman, of New York, as
a clerk in the Indian Office, will be dispensed with from
and after this date.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jas. Harlan</span>,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>Secretary of the Interior</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is obvious that the chief had no right to open his
clerk&rsquo;s desk and examine what he knew to be private
papers; but having done so, and being presumably of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
an unimaginative, narrowly pious and over-conscientious
character, we cannot wonder at his action. From
Whitman&rsquo;s point of view the matter was serious; he
could ill-afford a peremptory dismissal from the public
service. And to his friends the dismissal appeared not
so much unjust as enormous.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connor, hearing the news, went straight to Hubley
Ashton, in the fiery heat of that generous and righteous
wrath which scintillates and flashes with perfervid splendour
through the pages of his <i>Good Grey Poet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Mr.
Ashton was not so fierce, but he was indignant. He
was a member of the Administration, and used his
power to Whitman&rsquo;s advantage. Finding all remonstrance
with Mr. Harlan to be vain, he yet induced
him to make some sort of exchange by which Whitman
was not actually dismissed from the service, but only
transferred to his own department&mdash;the Attorney-General&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Painful at the time, the affair did Whitman little
injury. When Harlan&rsquo;s action became known it was
far from popular in Washington, where every one knew
Walt, and where next to nobody had read his <i>Leaves</i>.
A section at least of the local press supported the claims
of a fellow-pressman;<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> while in the Civil Service he
was a favourite with the clerks. In literary circles, also,
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s slashing attack upon the Secretary for the
Interior turned the tables in Walt&rsquo;s favour.</p>

<p>In later years assaults of the same character were not
infrequent, both upon <i>Leaves of Grass</i> and its author;
but, however annoying, they always resulted in arousing
curiosity, and thus in extending the circle of readers.
Probably the fear of this consequence prevented their
further multiplication, for average American opinion
was then undisguisedly hostile, as, of course, it still
remains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the whole, Whitman seems to have been happy
in his new office. He never tired of the view from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
window<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> in the second storey of the Treasury Building,
overlooking miles of river reaches with white sails upon
them, and the range of wooded Virginian hills. He
liked his companions, and he relished the green tea
which came in every afternoon from a girl in an adjacent
office;<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> not, indeed, intended for him, but resigned
to him by its recipient, who was scornful of the cup.</p>

<p>He <span class="correction" title="In the original book: went great">went on great</span> walks, especially by night, and enjoyed
his jaunts on the cars. One Thanksgiving Day we
find him picnicing by the falls of the Potomac, and on
another occasion he is visiting Washington&rsquo;s old mansion
at Mount Vernon.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Every Sunday till the close of
1866 he was in the hospitals, and frequently called at
one or other during the week. He was a regular visitor
at the homes of several friends, and his acquaintance
with Mr. Peter Doyle, which seems to have begun during
the last winter of the war, had ripened into a close
comradeship.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Burroughs had always to keep Sunday
breakfast waiting for him; there was a regularity in his
lateness.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> After a chat with them, and a glance through
the Sunday papers, he would stroll over to the office for
his letters on his way to some hospital, and during the
course of the afternoon he dropped in at the O&rsquo;Connors&rsquo;
for tea. In the winter he spent much of his leisure
by the fire in the comfortable Library of the Treasury
Building reading novels, philosophy and what he would.</p>

<p>He boarded at a pleasant house on M Street, near
Twelfth.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> It stood back from the road, with a long
sweep of sward in front of it, and an arbour under a
great cherry tree, which became in spring a hill of
snowy blossom. As the evenings grew warmer, Whitman
and his fellow-boarders would draw their chairs
out on to the grass and sit under the trees talking or
silently watching the passers-by, or listening to occasional
strolling players.</p>

<p>To his companions and to casual visitors he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
as strong as ever. He ate well, avoiding excess, and,
still adhering to his resolution, partaking but sparingly
of meat. He went to bed and rose early. Always
affable and courteous, he contrived to take his part in
the general conversation without saying much.</p>

<p>Such a life was easy, and passably comfortable; he
was earning a fair salary, and making new friends constantly.
But he was without a home; and Washington,
after all, as the seat of officialism, shows the seamy
side of democracy. The cynic declares that its population
consists exclusively of negroes, mean whites and
officials; thus presenting a melancholy contrast to the
metropolis of the fifties with its large class of vigorous-minded,
independent artisans, the backbone of a city
democracy as the yeoman-farmers are of a nation.</p>

<p>The routine also of the work he was doing must often
have been irksome to him.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> It is one of the enigmas of
Whitman&rsquo;s life that he should have been content to continue
in Washington six years at least after the hospitals
had ceased to claim him; sitting before a Government
desk as third clerk and earning his regular pay of rather
more than three hundred pounds a year.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> How great
the change from his old Bohemian days! The question
obtrudes, was Walt becoming &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Whether he were or no, at least he had become
noticeably better clad and less aggressive, a gentler
seeming man than of old.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> And yet there was always
something illusive about this apparent change. He
could still turn the face of a rock to impertinent
intruders;<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> he could still blaze out in sudden anger
upon a rare occasion.</p>

<p>But he was near fifty now, and for several years the
strong sympathies of his nature had been fully and continually
exercised in the wards. His individuality was as
marked as ever; but with the war he had experienced a
deeper sense of his membership in the life of the Race.
The word &ldquo;<i>en-masse</i>,&rdquo; now so often on his lips, expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
this constant consciousness. It was not new to him,
but its dominance was new.</p>

<p>Again, while he had seen before that, in general, every
soul is divine, it was the days and nights which he spent
in the wards which made him understand how divine it
actually is. The meaning of love grows richer in its
exercise, and this was doubtless true in the case of
Walt Whitman.</p>

<p>The experience of recent years had cleansed his
self-assertion of qualities which were merely fortuitous.
Never intentionally eccentric, he had previously perhaps
exaggerated the traits which were peculiar to a stage
in the development of his own personality. But the
crucible heat of the wards rid him of that, while integrating
his nature more perfectly. Living more intensely
than ever, he was living more than ever in the
lives of others; and this inevitably made him more
catholic.</p>

<p>Other circumstances aided in the same direction. His
manner of daily life had altered. He lived no longer
among his own folk at home, but instead among professional
men and clerks, at a middle-class Washington
boarding-house. He worked now with a pen, not a
hammer; and his book, written for the young American
artisan, was being read and appreciated, not at all by
him, but instead by students in Old and New England.
He lost nothing of himself by becoming one of this other
class in which for the time he lived with his book. A
smaller man might have been seriously affected by such
a change in environment; but while it could not be
without effect upon Whitman, it never made him less
true to his essential self.</p>

<p>In considering this period, I think we may say that
the Whitman of the later sixties was still the large
masculine man who wrote the first <i>Leaves of Grass</i>; but
having in 1860 completed the first plan of the book, his
task of self-assertion now became as it were a secondary
matter. The suffering and sympathy of the war had
developed the saviour in him; so that some of his
portraits, taken at the time, have almost the air of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
&ldquo;gentle shepherd&rdquo;. His message became increasingly
one of helpful love, newly adjusted to the individuals
among whom he was thrown.</p>

<p>And with the rise of a group of able young champions
and admirers, it became more necessary that he should
guard his message and himself from anything that could
encourage that habit of personal imitation which would
have created a group of little Whitmanites, whose very
ability must have limited the original inspiration which
had bound them to him.</p>

<p>Thus it was in a sense true that, after the publication
of the volume of 1860, the first Whitman was, as he
prophesied he would be, &ldquo;disembodied, triumphant,
dead&rdquo;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So much on the matter of Whitman&rsquo;s increased respectability:
as to his prolonged stay in Washington,
something further must be said.</p>

<p>It is evident that he was no longer the Titan of old
days. In the spring of 1867 he writes home that he is
well, but &ldquo;getting old&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and every year he seemed to
feel the extremes of the Washington climate more and
more. This is further evidence of decreasing vitality.</p>

<p>Had he returned to New York, it must probably have
been to write for the press; and however physically
robust he might suppose himself to be, something at
least of the old force of initiative had left him. There
was no longer any immediate need for his presence at
home; for when Jeff went West to St. Louis, as engineer
to the city waterworks, his brother George was there to
take his place as the mother&rsquo;s main support.</p>

<p>Walt was, moreover, earning a sufficient income in
an easy fashion. The work itself was light; he was
trusted, and little supervised. His chief seems to have
recognised that he had spent himself unsparingly for
America in the hospitals, without immediate reward;
and now, in consequence, allowed him to arrange his
duties as suited him best. He spent but little of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
income upon himself; though the penurious simplicity
and discomfort of the early days was no longer desirable.
He always sent something to his mother, and seems to
have divided the remainder between any of his hospital
boys who still lingered; the beggars whom he never
refused; his friends, and the Savings Bank.</p>

<p>But one suspects that Whitman really stayed on in
Washington for the same reason that he had previously
remained in New York. He took root wherever he
stood; and it required the tug of duty to remove him.
Wherever he was, his life was full of incident and
material for thought. Outward occupation or adventure
counted for comparatively little in his experience. His
present circumstances favoured the steady progress of
his own writing and the prosecution of his friendships.</p>

<p>Not that he ever forgot his friends in the metropolis,
or grew indifferent to the claims of his family. He
contrived to spend at least a month every summer in
his old haunts, living at home and making daily expeditions
on the bay, bathing from the Coney Island
beach, and sauntering along Broadway.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> He often had
business at the printers&rsquo;, for he was now again his own
publisher.</p>

<p>The <i>Leaves</i> had been out of print since the failure
of his Boston friends, and in 1867 he was working
on a new edition, completing the very copy which
had roused the wrath of Mr. Harlan. He seems to
have spent a few days with his friend Mrs. Price;<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> and
coming down late to tea one evening, after working on
his manuscripts, one of the daughters has recorded the
extraordinary brightness and elation of his mien. &ldquo;An
almost irrepressible joyousness,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;shone from
his face and seemed to pervade his whole body. It was
the more noticeable as his ordinary mood was one of
quiet yet cheerful serenity. I knew he had been working
at a new edition of his book, and I hoped if he had
an opportunity he would say something to let us into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
secret of his mysterious joy. Unfortunately, most of
those at the table were occupied with some subject of
conversation; at every pause I waited eagerly for him
to speak; but no, some one else would begin again,
until I grew almost wild with impatience and vexation.
He appeared to listen, and would even laugh at some of
the remarks that were made, yet he did not utter a
single word during the meal; and his face still wore
that singular brightness and delight, as though he had
partaken of some divine elixir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not always in joy that he wrote. Other
friends have told how they have noted him turning
aside from the street into some door or alleyway to take
out a slip of paper and write, with the tears running fast
across his face.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Whether in tears or in ecstasy, it is
certain that he composed his poems under the stress of
actual feeling; and of emotions which shook his whole
being and thrilled its heavy, slow-vibrating chords to
music.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center">FRIENDS AND FAME</p>


<p class="p2">In October, 1867, the new volume appeared; it was
intended to replace the former final edition of 1860,
and in itself was now regarded as final. Whitman
wrote home to his mother that at last he had finished
his re-arrangings and corrections, for good.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> But he
was mistaken; for because the book was a whole, every
page which he added to it in succeeding years entailed
a new revision of the rest. Each new note affects the
old sequence, which thus requires to be ordered anew.</p>

<p>The book might be handsomer, he says; but he
notes that he has omitted some excessive phrases, and
even dropped a passage or two which had not stood the
test of time; and now he feels that the volume proves
itself to any fair-minded person. Beyond these alterations,
the book contains little that is new.</p>

<p>That public interest in Whitman was increasing is
shown by the appearance this year of the first of those
brief biographical studies which have since become so
numerous. It was from the pen of his intimate friend,
Mr. John Burroughs, than whom none knew him better
during the Washington days; and having besides the
full advantage of Whitman&rsquo;s supervision, remains a
principal authority to this day.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Equally important was the preparation in England
this autumn of a volume of selections by Mr. W. M.
Rossetti.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The editor of the <i>Germ</i>, that most interesting
expression of a new and pregnant spirit in art whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
brief but brilliant course had ended a few years before
the first appearance of the <i>Leaves</i>, was the right man to
introduce Walt Whitman to the English reader. Both
he and his brother, the poet, had for several years been
admirers of Whitman&rsquo;s work; and before the publication
of the new edition he had written an able notice of
the book in <i>The Chronicle</i>, a short-lived organ of advanced
Catholic views.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>This was widely copied by the American press. It
preserves a judicial tone, which while fully appreciating
the literary value of the new work, is far from indiscriminate
praise. Mr. Rossetti frankly protested against
what he regarded as the gross treatment of gross things,
not so much on ethical as on æsthetic grounds; against
jarring words and faulty constructions. He noted the
obscurity and fragmentary character of many passages,
commented on the agglomerative or cataloguial habit,
and upon the author&rsquo;s justifiable, but at first sight
exasperating, self-assertion.</p>

<p>Much of this was, at least from its writer&rsquo;s literary
point of view, just and valuable criticism. Mr. Rossetti
was less fortunate when he asserted that if only he were
brought down by sickness many things would appear
very different to Whitman; for while the remark contains
an incontestable element of axiomatic truth, its
particular application was based upon a misapprehension
of the poet&rsquo;s character. He conceived that Whitman&rsquo;s
faith depended upon physical well-being&mdash;just as Walt
once declared that Goethe&rsquo;s religion was founded simply
upon good digestion and appetite&mdash;thus missing the
spiritual basis of his personality.</p>

<p>But if Rossetti&rsquo;s literary criticisms are searching and
upon the whole just, his praises are not less notable.
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> he describes as by far the largest poetical
performance of our period; and while acclaiming him
the founder of American poetry, he foresees that its
author&rsquo;s voice will one day be potential and magisterial
wherever the English language is spoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>The criticism was followed by the compilation of a
volume of selections containing nearly one half of the
current <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, and a large part of the original
Preface of 1855. The enterprise brought the compiler
into cordial personal relations with the poet.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> There
had at first been a slight misunderstanding as to
the scope of the English version, and an expurgated
but otherwise complete edition had been suggested.
Whitman could not be a party to such a volume, and
would naturally have preferred his own complete book
to any selections. But in Mr. Rossetti he recognised
an understanding friend. While frankly expressing his
own views, he was most cordial and generous in the declaration
of his faith in his correspondent&rsquo;s wisdom, and
of his desire to leave him unshackled.</p>

<p>The selections contained none of the poems which
had aroused the indignation of Mr. Harlan and his
friends, and would probably have more than satisfied
the very different criticisms of Emerson. Their publication
established the foundation of Whitman&rsquo;s English
fame, which now rapidly outstripped his American.
Already known to the few&mdash;to such men for instance
as Tennyson, Dante G. Rossetti, Swinburne, W. Bell
Scott, J. A. Symonds and Thomas Dixon&mdash;<i>Leaves of
Grass</i> was from this time eagerly sought after by a
considerable number of the younger and more vigorous
thinkers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although they never met, Whitman&rsquo;s friendship with
Symonds is so important that I cannot pass it by without
some reference to the younger man&rsquo;s character.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
He had been, as is well known, an exceptionally brilliant
Oxford scholar; who had shown so little trace of the
disqualifying elements of genius that his painfully accurate
poetic form carried off the Newdigate prize. After
his studies at Balliol, he entered early manhood with
impaired sight, an irritable brain and incipient consump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>tion.
His temper was naturally strenuous, but this
quality was accompanied by introspective morbidity.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1865, at the age of five and twenty,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
the late Mr. Frederick Myers introduced him to <i>Leaves
of Grass</i>; his reading of one of the Calamus poems&mdash;&ldquo;Long
I thought that knowledge alone would suffice
me&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>&mdash;from the edition of 1860, sending, as Symonds
says, electric thrills through the very marrow of his
bones. Whitman of course rode rough-shod over all the
scholar&rsquo;s academic and aristocratic prejudices, and required
slow assimilation. This process continued during
the next four years; but he says that the book became
eventually a more powerful formative influence in his
life than Plato&rsquo;s works,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> or indeed any other volume,
save the Bible.</p>

<p>Married already, and already largely an invalid, life
was full of difficulties for so keen and eager a mind; and
the <i>Leaves</i> became his anchor, especially the poems of
Calamus.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> It was in 1869 and 1870<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> that he realised
their full value.</p>

<p>Already his mind had responded to the idea of the
cosmos and of cosmic enthusiasm,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> suggested to it in the
Hymn of Cleanthes, in certain pages of Marcus Aurelius,
Giordano Bruno, Goethe, and the Evolutionists of his
own time. To these ideas Whitman brought conviction
and reality. It was through his study of the <i>Leaves</i>
that Symonds came to understand for himself the infinite
value and possibility of human comradeship, and became
a glad participant in the Universal Life.</p>

<p>For twenty years the two men corresponded as close
friends; and there were few in whose admiration for
his work Whitman found such keen satisfaction. But
Addington Symonds was always a conscientious as well
as an affectionate and reverent friend; and while at a
later date he publicly protested against Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s
assault,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and in his posthumous study of Whitman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
proved himself second to none in his admiration of him
whom he called Master, yet he himself made some of
the frankest and most trenchant criticisms of his friend&rsquo;s
work. He thus preserved his independence, and, unlike
that of the mere disciple, his praise of Whitman is
rendered really valuable by this quality.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1869, Mr. Madox Brown lent a copy
of the <i>Selections</i> to his friend Mrs. Alexander Gilchrist,
the widow of Blake&rsquo;s biographer. She responded to
the book&rsquo;s appeal, and immediately borrowed Mr. Rossetti&rsquo;s
copy of the complete volume.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> While wholly
approving the omission from his <i>Selections</i> of such
poems as the &ldquo;Children of Adam,&rdquo; and herself making
some partial reservation with regard to these as
perhaps infringing in certain passages the natural law of
concealment and modesty, she expressed to Mr. Rossetti,
in fervid and impassioned phrases, the joy that came to
her in this new gospel, worthy at last as she thought of
America. Her friend obtained her permission to allow
her letters to him to be published; and they appeared in
the Boston <i>Radical</i> for May, 1870.</p>

<p>Her words of womanly understanding stirred Whitman
too deeply for much outward expression.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> He hardly
regarded them as a declaration of individual friendship,
showing himself at the time even a little indifferent<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> to
the personality of their writer. They were, he knew,
a testimony not so much to him as to his <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,
which were a half-impersonal utterance, and as such
he received them with gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Nothing, not even
O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s brilliant vindication, had so justified the
poems to their maker.</p>

<p>Whitman has been roundly abused by Mr. Swinburne<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
and others, because, as they say, he lacks the romantic
attitude toward woman. Mr. Meredith has shown in his
own inimitable way the fiends that mask themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
too often under this romantic mien; and one is not
always sure whether Whitman&rsquo;s honesty is not in itself
a little distasteful to some of his critics.</p>

<p>It is true that he has addressed woman as the mother
or the equal mate of man, rather than as the maid unwed,
as though his thought of sex transcended the
limits usually assigned to it. I am persuaded that the
explanation of this is to be found in the fact that Whitman&rsquo;s
mystic consciousness had broken many of the
barriers which have constricted the passion of sex too
narrowly during past centuries. He heard all the deeps
of life calling to one another and responding with
passionate avowals of life&rsquo;s unity. The soul of the lover&mdash;as
all the poets have been telling us since Dante&rsquo;s day&mdash;discovers
its true self in the beloved person: but the
soul of Whitman discovered itself as surely and as
passionately in the Beloved World. The expression is
so novel that it sounds well-nigh absurd to ears that do
not &ldquo;hear&rdquo;. But for those who can hear, Whitman&rsquo;s
voice is all surcharged with the lover&rsquo;s passion; not less
intense but larger in its sanity than the voices of other
poets.</p>

<p>Again we may justly urge that, in general, it was
Woman as Madonna, rather than as Venus, whom he
contemplated. Or shall we say he saw the Madonna in
Venus, as Botticelli did? His love, when he wrote,
was that of a man of middle life, in whom the yearning
tenderness of fatherhood mingled with the other currents
of passion. His vision beheld the Divine Child, without
whom love itself is incomplete. For fatherhood and
motherhood are seen by the insight of the poet to be
implicit in the passion of sex, and it was impossible for
Whitman, the seer, to think of one apart from the other.</p>

<p>As a wife and a mother, Anne Gilchrist recognised the
beauty and purity of Whitman&rsquo;s conception of love; and
his book was to her like the presence of a great and wise
comrade.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> She was the first woman who had publicly
recognised his purpose in these poems, and it was an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
of no small heroism.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> Whitman might well be moved
by it.</p>

<p>The <i>Selections</i> had appeared in 1868, a year which also
saw the publication<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> of O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s tale, <i>The Carpenter</i>,
in whose pages commences that legendary element in
Whitman&rsquo;s story, which follows the advent of the more
striking personalities. Here Whitman is confused with
Christ, somewhat as was Francis by his followers, more
than six centuries before.</p>

<p>That such a thing should have been possible in the
Whitman circle requires a few words of explanation. I
have already described the poem in which he himself
claims comradeship with &ldquo;the Crucified&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The further
assertion of such a claim inevitably fell to O&rsquo;Connor,
whose work was always marked by an element of vehemence
and even of excess. Brilliant, generous, eloquent,
he was oftener a fervid partisan than a safe critic.</p>

<p>Having already coupled Whitman&rsquo;s name with the
greatest in literature<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>&mdash;an act of audacity, even if we
accept the conjunction&mdash;it was but natural that, finding
the man himself nobler even than his works, he should
compare him with the greatest masters of human life.
He was not satisfied even with the praises he had piled
upon his hero in his indignant rejoinder to the Hon.
James Harlan.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s tale is of no great value; but it reminds
us that there was in Walt something which bewildered
those who knew him best: something Jove-like says
one;<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> something that, judged by ordinary standards,
was superhuman, alike in its calm breadth of view and
its capacity for love. They observed that what others
might do under the constraint of exceptional influences,
of intellectual conviction, moral ideal or religious enthusiasm,
he did naturally. He did not rise to an
occasion, but always embraced opportunity as though
from a higher level. He was not shocked or alienated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
things which shocked other men; and personal slights
and injuries hardly touched him, dropping from him at
once. He was the best of comrades, and yet he was a
man of deep reserve. And he was so many-sided that
his friends were hardly aware that he concealed something
of himself from them. Always when you met
him again you found him bigger than you had remembered
him; and the better you knew him, the less certain
you would be of accurately forecasting his actions or
understanding his thoughts.</p>

<p>If, however, we call him superhuman, it must be by
an unusual manner of speech; for he was, as we know,
the most human of men, seeming to be personally
familiar and at home with every fragment of humanity.
He comprehended the springs of action in individuals,
as the soul comprehends the purpose of each limb and
article of the body. He had the understanding which
comes through a subtle sympathy with the whole of
things.</p>

<p>Explain or ignore it as we will, there is in every man
that which is Divine; but usually this side of his nature
is, as it were, turned away from view. Our personality
has deeps which even our own consciousness has not
plumbed, though at times it catches a glimpse of them.
And we know that there are men whose consciousness
is as much deeper than ours as ours is deeper than
that of a babe. Whitman was one of these; and the
fact that he was such a one must always render the
writing of his biography a tentative task. It seems as
though O&rsquo;Connor, feeling this, had thrown his own
attempt at portraiture into the form of a sort of parable.
For his friends, while they saw possibilities in him which
they also recognised in themselves, saw also others
which bewildered them by their suggestions of the old
hero-stories; and it cannot therefore be wondered, if
sometimes they found in his life a similitude to that of
the Nazarene.</p>

<p>The world is ever telling over the old legends, and
wondering in spite of itself if, after all, they might be
true. In our nobler moments we find ourselves rebelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
against the traditional limitations of our manhood;
something within our own hearts assures us that
humanity is destined to attain a nobler stature. Every
new revelation of the possibilities of life, every new incarnation
of humanity in some great soul, brings to our
lips the name of Jesus. For in it the aspirations of the
world&rsquo;s childhood have been made our own.</p>

<p>We can never believe that the story of the Christ
closed with the earthly career of Jesus. We know that
He will come again; that humanity will renew its
promise; that the old stock will break once more into
prophetic blossom. And waiting and watching, at the
advent of every great one, our hearts cry out the ineffable
name of our hope, at whose very hearing the soul of faith
is refreshed. Every great soul assures us that the old,
old stories are more than true; they are prophetic for
our very selves; speaking to us of a Divine destiny and
purpose to which we, too, may&mdash;nay, must&mdash;eventually
arise. To Whitman&rsquo;s closest friends such was his
gospel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But it was not every one who could read him so
significantly. Merely intellectual people, trying him by
their own standards, often found him stupid. A young
doctor, for instance, who had known him in New York,
and was now a fellow-boarder with him upon M Street,
records his own impression formed at this time, that
Walt was physically lazy and intellectually hazy;<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> that
his conversation was disappointingly enigmatic and
obscure, and his words were misty, shadowy, elusive
adumbrations. His vocabulary, says this gentleman,
even when he was deeply affected by natural scenes,
was almost grotesquely inadequate; they were &ldquo;tip-top,&rdquo;
he would declare; and you could only gather
from his manner and the tone of his voice that he
meant more than a shabby commonplace.</p>

<p>The doctor, who was doubtless an encyclopædia of
accurate knowledge, found his companion sadly ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
of the common names of the trees and birds they noticed
on their rambles. A few years later, however, Whitman
displayed so considerable a knowledge in these directions
that one may at least suppose he profited considerably
from his companion&rsquo;s information.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> And even if he did
not know their names, he came near to knowing their
actual personality; which is probably more than even
the worthy doctor attempted.</p>

<p>It is very certain that Whitman was no dreamer
of vague dreams. His face at this time was equally
expressive of alertness and of calm. His small eyes,
grey-blue under their heavy-drooping passionate lids,
were of an extraordinarily penetrating vision. They
were the eyes of a spirit which looked out through them
ceaselessly as from behind a shelter. Circled by a definite
line, they had the perceptive draining quality of
a child&rsquo;s when it is first awake to all the world&rsquo;s storehouse
of strange things.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Never a merely passive
onlooker, he was always a dynamic force, challenging
and evoking the manhood of his friends.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is notably the case in his relations with Peter
Doyle, of whom I have already spoken as one of Walt&rsquo;s
closest companions during the greater part of the Washington
period. Doyle was a young Catholic, born in
Ireland but raised in the Virginian Alexandria.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> His
father, a blacksmith and machinist, eventually went to
work in a Richmond foundry; and when the war broke
out, Pete, who was a mere lad, entered the Confederate
army. Soon after, he was wounded and made a prisoner,
and being carried to Washington, he obtained during his
convalescence<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> the post of conductor on one of the tram-cars
running upon Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a
course of some four miles, from Georgetown, by the
White House and Treasury and near to Armory
Square, up the hill by the Capitol and down again to
near the Navy Yard on the Anacostia River. And in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
a course he was bound sooner or later to make the
acquaintance of Whitman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i231.jpg" width="600" height="704" alt="Drawing of Doyle at twenty-two and Walt at fifty." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">DOYLE AT TWENTY-TWO AND WHITMAN AT FIFTY</p></div>
</div>

<p>Their meeting occurred one wild stormy night, perhaps
in the winter of 1864-65,<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> when Pete was about eighteen.
Walt had been out to see John Burroughs, and was
returning wrapt around in his great blanket-rug, the
only passenger in the car. Pete was cold and lonely:
something about the big red-faced man within promised
fellowship and warmth. So he entered the car and put
his hand impulsively on Walt&rsquo;s knee. Walt was pleased;
they seemed to understand one another at once; and
instead of descending at his destination, the older man
rode an extra four miles that night for friendship&rsquo;s
sake.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Pete was a fair well-built lad, with a warm Irish
heart; and in Walt, who was old enough to have been
his father, the fraternal and paternal qualities alike were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
very strong. Separated from his own children, and his
own younger brothers whom he had dearly loved, his
heart&rsquo;s tenderness expended itself upon other lads, and
upon none more than upon Pete. There are few ties
stronger than those which bind together the man or
woman of middle life whose sympathies are still natural
and warm, and the adolescent lad or maiden upon life&rsquo;s
threshold.</p>

<p>Whitman did not appear merely as a good fellow to
his young comrade: his affection ran too deep for that.
This is well illustrated by an incident in their relationship.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
In a passing fit of despondency Pete declared
that life was no longer worth living, and that he had
more than half a mind to end it. Walt answered him
sharply; he was very angry and not a little shocked.
This occurred upon the evening of his departure for
Brooklyn for one of his visits home, and the two
separated somewhat coldly.</p>

<p>Walt arrived really ill, suffering from a sort of partial
and temporary paralysis, which seems to have attacked
him at times during the latter part of his residence in
Washington. As soon as he was sufficiently recovered,
he wrote his friend a letter full of loving reproaches,
of affectionate calls to duty, and promises of assistance.
The unmanly folly of Pete&rsquo;s words had, he says, repelled
him; but afterwards the sense of his indestructible love
for the lad had returned again in fuller measure than
ever, and he became certain that it was not the real
Pete, &ldquo;my darling boy, my young and loving brother,&rdquo;
who had spoken those wicked words. He adjures him,
by his love for his widowed mother and for Walt his
comrade, to be a man.</p>

<p>Many of the letters to Pete, during the vacations in
Brooklyn from 1868 to 1872, are marked by a sort of
paternal anxiety for the young man&rsquo;s welfare. Pete
was impulsive and emotional; he was not one to whom
study or thrift was naturally easy. Walt aided him all
he could in both directions. He was always encouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
his &ldquo;boys&rdquo; to read good books, combining still, as in
earlier years, the rôles of teacher and comrade; but he
never checked in any degree his friend&rsquo;s boyish, generous
and pleasure-loving nature. And his love was returned
with the whole-hearted loyal devotion of the true Celt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">
<img src="images/i233.jpg" width="565" height="800" alt="Picture of Peter Doyle at fifty-seven." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PETER G. DOYLE AT FIFTY-SEVEN</p></div>
</div>

<p>This friendship with Doyle was only one among many,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
and the fact that Pete was a Catholic and had been a
Confederate soldier, shows how far such relations transcended
any mere similarity of opinion. Indeed, there is
nothing more notable in the circle of Whitman&rsquo;s friends
than their extraordinary dissimilarity one from another.</p>

<p>Day after day, Pete would come to the Treasury
building after his work was done, and wait sleepily
there till Walt was free; when they would start off
upon a stroll, which often extended itself for many
miles into the country. Walt frequently had other
companions upon these rambles. Sometimes it would
be John Burroughs, and sometimes quite a party of
men, laughing, singing and talking gaily together as
they went.</p>

<p>Whitman was the heart of good-fellowship; he was
the oldest of them in years, but in years only. One
wonders sometimes whether he himself realised that all
these men were so much his juniors. There was no
comrade, either man or woman, who had grown up
beside him, learning with him the lessons of life. His
mother was the great link with his own boyhood, and
the letters which he wrote to her from Washington<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
show how strong was his attachment to her, and how
great his capacity for home-love.</p>

<p>It is, then, not a little tragic that he had no home
to call his own. In a sense he was a solitary man; in
the midst of his all-embracing love and his self-revealing
poems, Walt Whitman lived his life apart and kept many
secrets. In spirit he was as solitary as Thoreau, nay,
even more than he, for, though his fellowship was with
the life Universal, his consciousness of it seemed unique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>His self-reliant, masculine nature was attractive to
women, with whom he had, as one of his friends
phrased it, &ldquo;a good way&rdquo;. With them and with
children he was natural and happy.</p>

<p>Vague and anonymous figures of women move from
time to time across his story. In 1863 it is with &ldquo;a
lady&rdquo; that he first remarks the President&rsquo;s sadness.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
In 1868 he has great talks and jolly times with the
girls he meets on a trip in New England,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and he writes
of his &ldquo;particular women friends in New York&rdquo;. In
1869 he declares laughingly, he is quite a lady&rsquo;s man
again as in the old days.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Women trusted him instinctively, and he repayed
their trust by a remarkable silence as to his relations
with them. He understood the hearts of women, for
there was in him much of the maternal. This quality
often finds quaint expression in his letters to Pete, who
is &ldquo;dear baby&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> sometimes, and who found more than
one kiss sent him upon the paper.</p>

<p>As he became famous, Whitman had his queue of
visitors. Now it is a spiritualistic woman, who breaks
off her interview in order to converse with the spirit
of Abraham Lincoln; and now a Mrs. McKnight,<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> who
would paint his portrait. Later, when he fell ill, &ldquo;Mary
Cole&rdquo; came and ministered to him.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor,
with Mrs. Burroughs and Mrs. Ashton, belonged to the
circle of his friends. With women, as with men, he had
his own frank way of expressing affection, and many a
time he greeted them with a kiss, knowing it would not
be misinterpreted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From 1868 to 1870 he was engaged upon a brief
political treatise, apparently suggested to him by Carlyle&rsquo;s
vehement assault upon Democracy and all its
ways, in <i>Shooting Niagara</i>.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>Life in Washington during and after the war had
made the short-comings of Democracy very evident to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
Whitman. The failure of President Johnson and his
attempted impeachment, had been followed by drastic
measures for enforcing Republican ideas in the South
by all the abominable methods known to corruption
and carpet-bag politicians. The year 1868 saw the
election of Grant to the Presidency, and under him
corruption extended in every direction. Grant&rsquo;s real
work was finished at Appomattox,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> and his eight years
of official life added nothing to his fame. But Whitman,
sharing the national regard for a simple-minded, downright
soldier, heartily approved his nomination, and urged
his brothers to support him.</p>

<p>For the carpet-bag reconstruction of the South he
had, of course, no sympathy. He longed for a union
of hearts, and looked ardently forward to the day when
the South, whom he loved so passionately, would realise
again her inalienable part in the Union. Without her
America was incomplete. And in the &ldquo;magnet South&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
was much that was personally dearest to Whitman&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>The more extreme Abolitionist sentiment had combined
with the exigency of party to create a position
in the Southern States which was intolerable to all
right feeling. The suffrage had been taken away from
the rebellious whites and given instead to the negroes.
It was as though the management of the household
affairs should be entrusted to wholly irresponsible children.
One need hardly add that it was not the negro
who ruled, but the political agent who bought his vote
and made a tool of him. Such a policy only exasperated
the antagonism between North and South.</p>

<p>And Whitman, though he hated slavery, saw that
the negro was not ready to exercise the full rights of
citizenship. When the negro vote in the capital became
dominant in political elections, and the black population
paraded the city in their thousands, armed and insolent,
they seemed to him &ldquo;like so many wild brutes let loose&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span></p>
<p>It was upon this question of negro-citizenship that he
quarrelled with O&rsquo;Connor. They had been arguing the
subject, as O&rsquo;Connor would insist on doing, and Walt,
for the nonce, had the better of the bout. Thoughtlessly,
and in the heat of the moment, he pressed his
advantage too far; O&rsquo;Connor lost his temper&mdash;perhaps
Walt did the same&mdash;but when a moment later the older
man returned to his usual good humour and held out
his hand warmly to his friend, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s wrath was
still hot; he was offended and refused the reconciliation.
In spite of their friends the sad estrangement continued
for years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The political treatise appeared at last under the title
of <i>Democratic Vistas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> It is the outcome of Whitman&rsquo;s
experiences and meditations upon the purpose of social
and national life, especially during the last decade in
Washington. In many respects it is an enlargement of
portions of the first Preface.</p>

<p>In these fragmentary political memoranda Whitman
is seen as the antagonist of what is often supposed to
be the American character. The book is a scathing
attack upon American complacency, which is even more
detestable to Whitman than it was to Carlyle. He recognises
the vulgarity and corruption that everywhere
abound; the superficial smartness and alert commercial
cunning which have taken the place of virtues in the
current code of transatlantic morals. Flippant, infidel,
unwholesome, mean-mannered; so he characterises New
York, his beloved city. As fiercely as Carlyle he detests
all the shams and hypocrises of democratic government,
and he is as keen to discover the perils of universal suffrage.</p>

<p>But withal he holds fast to faith, and offers a constructive
ideal. The jottings are threaded together by
the reiterated declaration that national life will never
become illustrious without a national literature. It is
precisely here, says he, that America is fatally deficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
Except upon the field of politics, what single thing of
moral value has she originated? And what possible
value has all her material development unless it be
accompanied by a corresponding development of soul?</p>

<p>There is something like an inconsistency of attitude
in this book; for here, on the one hand, we have Whitman
assuming the rôle of the moralist, denouncing,
menacing, upbraiding, and generally allowing himself
to employ the moralist&rsquo;s exaggerated, because partial,
manner of speech. On the other hand, we find, interspersed
among these passages of condemnation, others
which assert his unwavering faith in the issue, his constant
sense of the heroic character of the people.</p>

<p>Whitman never professed consistency, but his inconsistency
is generally explicable enough. In this case he
is of course denouncing the America of his day, only
because he is regarding her from the popular point of
view as something perfect and complete. He has faith
in America when he views her as a promise of what she
shall be; but even then only because he sees far into
her essential character. The shallow, popular optimism
is, he knows, wholly false; for if America is to triumph,
as he believes she will, it can only be by the profound
moral forces which are silently at work beneath the
trivial shows of her prosperity.</p>

<p>The last enemy of the Republic was not slain when
the slave party of secession, with its feudal spirit, was
overcome. The victory of the North has for the present
secured American unity, and with it the broad types
both of Northern and of Southern character essential to
the creation of a generous and profound national spirit.
But America has set forth upon the most tremendous
task ever conceived by man; a task indeed beyond the
scope of any man&rsquo;s thought. Urged on by the inner
destiny-forces of the race, she is attempting to realise
the race-ideal of a true democracy. To accomplish her
errand she must be nerved and vitalised by the highest
and deepest of ideals; for hers is a world-battle with
all the relentless foes of progress.</p>

<p>Whitman, seeing clearly the dark aspect of the future,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
the wars and revolutions yet in store, and having counted
the cost of them, though he had faith that America
would eventually achieve her purpose, yet might well
be foremost in scourging her light moods of optimism
with bitter words. And though he had not despaired
of America&mdash;and even if he had, would have been the
last man to suggest despair to others&mdash;though, also, he
knew and loved the real soul of the nation; he was not
so blind to possibilities of disaster, possibilities which
he had faced more than once in recent years, as to suppose
that she was of necessity chosen to be the elder
sister of the Republics of the coming centuries.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>On the contrary, while he had no doubt of the growth
and progress of humanity, he knew that a branch of the
race might wither away prematurely; and he saw in the
current culture and social beliefs of the city populations
a wholly false and mischievous conception of American
destiny. If the people of America were to perceive
nothing but a field for money-making wherever the
Stars and Stripes might float, then their patriotism would
be worthless, and the Republic must fall.</p>

<p>He loved America too passionately to be cynically indifferent
as to her fate. In spite of unworthy qualities,
she yet might realise the world&rsquo;s hope. But seeking
ardently for a way, there was only one that Whitman
could see; it was the way of religion. The old priestcraft
was effete, but religion had not died with it.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> In
a new fellowship of prophet-poets, who should awaken
the Soul of the Nation in the hearts of their hearers, as
did the prophet-poets of Israel, in these and in these
alone he had assurance&mdash;for already he seemed to behold
them afar off&mdash;assurance of the future of his
land.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>Whitman agreed with Carlyle as to the infinite value
to the race of great men. He continually asserts their
necessity to Democracy; not, indeed, as masters and
captains so much as interpreters and as prophets. The
truly great man includes more of the meaning of Democracy
than the little man, and is therefore the better
fitted to explain the purpose of the whole. Moreover,
according to Whitman, it is for the creation of great
personalities that Democracy exists; for he differs widely
from the Platonic mysticism with its Ideal State as the
goal of personal achievement.</p>

<p>He includes in his philosophy of society what is best
both in the individualistic and the socialistic theories. He
sees progress depending upon the interplay of two forces,
which he calls the two sexes of Democracy<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>&mdash;Solidarity
and Personality. It is for great souls to declare in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
name of Personality the fundamental truth of Democracy,
that every man is destined to become a god. They
must realise for themselves, and assert for the world,
that a man well-born, well-bred and well-trained, may
and must become a law unto himself.</p>

<p>According to Whitman, the one purpose of all government
in a democracy is to encourage by all possible
means the development of Soul-consciousness in every
man and woman without any exception.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> For, speaking
generally, one may affirm that every fragment of
humanity is ultimately capable of the heroism which is
the force at humanity&rsquo;s heart; but each fragment can
only realise its possibilities as a part of the whole, and
as sharing in the life of Solidarity.</p>

<p>To accomplish this destiny, and not for reasons of
merit, Democracy encourages and requires of every one
a participation in the duties and privileges of citizenship.
And similarly, it requires that every one should be an
owner of property in order that each may have his own
material cell in the body politic.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>All persons are not yet prepared for citizenship; but
such as are minors must be wisely and strenuously
prepared, for Democracy suffers until all become true
citizens.</p>

<p>The idle and the very poor are always a menace to
Democracy.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>Even a greater menace, if that be possible, is to be
found in the low standard of womanhood which still
prevails in America. Woman, if only she would leave
her silliness and her millinery,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> and enter the life of
reality and enterprise, would, by the majesty of maternity,
be more than the equal of man. I think,
though approving of women&rsquo;s suffrage, he doubted
whether it could effect the change he desired to see.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that, like Plato, he saw in
the triviality of the women of the upper classes especially,
one of the gravest dangers which beset the
Republic. For the aim of Democracy is great free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
personalities, and these can only be produced from a
noble maternity. Unless motherhood and fatherhood
in all their aspects become a living science,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and the
practice of personal health is recognised as the finest of
the arts, any achievement of the purpose of Democracy
must be slow indeed.</p>

<p>Of other and very secondary kinds of culture, desirable
enough in their place, America, he continues, has
no lack. In some respects she is more European than
Europe. But to personality, and the moral force which
is personality, she is alarmingly indifferent. We have
fussed about the world, cries this stern speaker of truth
to his age and nation; we have gathered together its
art and its sciences, but we have not grown great in our
own souls. Our mean manners result precisely from
that.</p>

<p>Thus he returns to reiterate the cry that can always
be heard whenever we open any book of his, the cry of
the quintessential importance of religion in every field
of human life.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> For religion is the life of the soul; that
is to say, it is the heart of life.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s religion, however, is not that which is
taught by churches and churchmen. It is a religion
extricated from the churches. In a notable passage<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
he declares: &ldquo;Bibles may convey, and priests expound,
but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of
one&rsquo;s isolated self to enter the pure ether of veneration,
reach the Divine levels, and commune with the unutterable&rdquo;.
In short, religion is moral or spiritual
force: it is that which forms and maintains existence:
without it, the continued life of nation or individual
is inconceivable.</p>

<p>For a nation, too, has its soul-identity; and must
become conscious of that if it is to live, much more if it
is to lead. The awakening of America to this consciousness
of its spiritual purpose Whitman awaits, as the
prophets of Israel awaited the Messiah.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> And we may
add that with its realisation of nationhood, there comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
to a people the sense of its membership in the solidarity
of the race.</p>

<p>Now this soul-consciousness, he proceeds, comes to a
nation through its literature. In its songs and in its
great epics, a people tells and reads the secrets of its life;
it sees there, as in a glass, the Divine purpose which
tabernacles in its own heart.</p>

<p>A literature which can do this for America will not
be made by merely correct and clever college men, or
by fanciful adepts in the arts of verse. Those who
make it must breathe the open air of Nature; they
must, in the largest sense, be men of science. But in
Whitman&rsquo;s language nature and science include more
than the material and the seen. They are the world of
reality and its knowledge; and the soul is the essence
of reality: wherefore its experience is the sum of knowledge.</p>

<p>Thus made, literature will for the first time be worthy
to quicken and immortalise the life of America.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> It
will feed the infant life of the real nation. Reading it,
Americans will become aware at last of their world-destiny;
and they will face the whole of life and death
with a new faith and joy. America will become not
merely a new world, but the mother of new worlds:<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
and lowering as the skies must often be, and tragic
though the day&rsquo;s end, she will behold the stars beyond.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such, in crudest outline, is the gist of Whitman&rsquo;s
tractate; which, with the fifth edition of the <i>Leaves</i>,
appeared early in 1871. <i>Leaves of Grass</i> now included
<i>Drum-taps</i>; but the poems of President Lincoln&rsquo;s death,
with other matter suggested by the close of the war,
were separately published in a little volume of 120
pages, which, while containing poems upon the lines
suggested in <i>Democratic Vistas</i>, and reverting again to
old themes, was more especially marked by those in
which the idea of death as a voyage upon an unknown
sea is dominant.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FAC-SIMILE OF MS. BY WHITMAN, BELONGING PROBABLY TO 1875</p></div>
</div>

<p>The little book was called <i>Passage to India</i>, after the
opening poem; and it has a completeness of its own,
closing with a &ldquo;Now Finalé to the Shore&rdquo;. In its preface,
he alludes to a plan which he had entertained&mdash;his
active imagination entertained so many plans which he
never realised!<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>&mdash;the scheme of a new volume to companion
and complement the <i>Leaves</i>, suggestive of death
and the disembodied soul, as the <i>Leaves</i> were of the life
in the body. He found, however, that the body was
not so soon to be put aside; to the end, its hold upon
him was extraordinarily tenacious. Doubting his ability
for the task, he became content to offer a fragment and
hint of what he had intended.</p>

<p><i>Passage to India</i> is among his finest efforts.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Some
of its single lines ring like clear bells, while the movement
of the whole is varied, solemn and majestic.
He shows his reader how the enterprise and invention
of the world is binding all lands together to complete
the &ldquo;rondure&rdquo; of the earth. The opening of the Suez
Canal and of the Pacific Railroad are fulfilling the
dream of the Genoese, who sought a passage to India in
the circumnavigation of the world.</p>

<p>But, says Whitman, with that characteristic mystical
touch which is never absent in his poems, it is only the
poet who conceives of the world as really one and
round. For none but he understands that the universe
is essentially one, Soul and Matter, Nature and Man.
To the mystic sense, India becomes symbolic of all the
first elemental intuitions of the human race. Thither
now again the poet leads his nation, back to its first
visions and back to God.</p>

<p>Returning almost to the phrases of his first great
poem,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Whitman declares his sureness of God, and his
resolve not to dally with the Divine mystery. For him,
God is the heart of all life, but especially the heart of
all life that is true, good and loving: He is the reservoir
of the spiritual, and He is the soul&rsquo;s perfect and immortal
comrade. Thus Whitman&rsquo;s idea of God em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>braces
the &ldquo;personal&rdquo; element, so-called, which has
been predicated by Christian experience and dogma.</p>

<p>When the soul has accomplished its &ldquo;Passage to
India&rdquo;&mdash;has realised the unity of all<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>&mdash;then, says he,
it will melt into the arms of its Elder Brother, the
Divine Love. He does not mean that it will lose its
slowly gained consciousness of selfhood; but that, to
employ a formula of the Christian faith, it will enter
the Godhead as a distinct Person. For the Godhead of
Whitman&rsquo;s theology is the ultimate unity of ultimate
personalities&mdash;Many-in-one, the God of Love, the Heart
of Communion or Fellowship.</p>

<p>It is with a splendid cry of adventurous delight and
heroic ardour that Whitman sets out upon his perilous
voyage, seeking the meaning of everything and of the
whole, all hazards and dangers before him, upon all the
seas of the Unknown: but not foolhardily&mdash;&ldquo;Are they
not all the seas of God?&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In passing, we may note that in these Washington
poems the feeling for formal perfection is often clearly
manifested. Many of the shorter lyrics repeat the
opening line at their close. And careful reading, or
better, recitation, will show that some at least of the
longer poems are constructed with a broad, architectonic
plan.</p>

<p>It is indeed a great mistake to suppose that Whitman
was careless of form. Paradoxical though it sound, it
was nothing but his overwhelming sense of the necessity
for a living incarnation of his motive-emotions which
led him to abandon the accepted media of written expression.
He probably laboured as closely, deliberately
and long upon his loose-rhythmed verses as a more
precious stylist upon his. Whether successful or no,
he was most conscientious and self-exacting in his
obedience to the creative impulse, and in his selection
of such cadences and words as seemed to his ear the
best to render its precise import.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Probably the quiet life at Washington, and the intercourse
there with studious and thoughtful men and
women, helped his artistic sense. With a few exceptions,
however, the Washington poems are somewhat
less inevitable and procreative in their quality than
those of an earlier period. They are not less interesting,
but they are less elemental.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;The older he gets,&rdquo; wrote a correspondent of the
<i>New York Evening Mail</i>, &ldquo;the more cheerful and gay-hearted
he grows.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Though he was now beginning to
wear glasses, his jolly voice as he sang blithely over his
bath, and his thrush-like whistle,<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> his hearty appetite
and love of exercise, bore witness to vigour and good
spirits.</p>

<p>The circle of his friends grew daily wider, and a
measure of international fame began to come to him.
Both in Germany and in France his book was being
read, criticised and admired.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Rossetti&rsquo;s selections had
given him an English public, which was eager now for
new editions of his complete poems; he had cordial
letters from Tennyson and Addington Symonds; Swinburne
addressed him in one of his &ldquo;Songs before Sunrise,&rdquo;
and there were many others.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>From time to time he would receive an invitation
from some academic or other body to recite a poem at
a public function. Thus, in the autumn of 1871, he
gave his &ldquo;Song of the Exposition&rdquo; at the opening of
the annual exhibition of the American Institute;<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> it
is a half-humorous poem, which follows some of the
political themes suggested in <i>Democratic Vistas</i>. Again,
at midsummer, 1872, he recited &ldquo;As a Strong Bird on
Pinions Free&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> on the invitation of the United Literary
Societies of Dartmouth College, in New Hampshire;
making at this time a further tour as far as Lake
Champlain, to visit his sister Hannah, who was married
unhappily and far from all her people.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Later the same autumn, old Mrs. Whitman left
Brooklyn to live with her son, the colonel, in Camden;
a quiet unattractive artisan suburb of Philadelphia.
The old lady, now nearly eighty, partially crippled by
rheumatism, and a widow for some eighteen years, did
not long survive this transplanting. But sorrows came
thick upon the Whitmans at this time. And first of
all, it was Walt himself who broke down and was
house-tied.</p>

Mr. Burroughs&rsquo; <i>Birds and Poets</i> gives so graphic a description of Whitman
at this time, that I cannot forbear to quote it:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I give here a glimpse of him in Washington, on a Pennsylvania
Avenue and Navy Yard horse-car, toward the close of the war, one
summer day at sundown. The car is crowded and suffocatingly hot,
with many passengers on the rear platform, and among them a bearded,
florid-faced man, elderly but agile, resting against the dash, by the side
of the young conductor, and evidently his intimate friend. The man
wears a broad-brim white hat. Among the jam inside near the door, a
young Englishwoman, of the working class, with two children, has had
trouble all the way with the youngest, a strong, fat, fretful, bright babe
of fourteen or fifteen months, who bids fair to worry the mother completely
out, besides becoming a howling nuisance to everybody. As the
car tugs around Capitol Hill, the young one is more demoniac than
ever, and the flushed and perspiring mother is just ready to burst into
tears with weariness and vexation. The car stops at the top of the hill
to let off most of the rear platform passengers, and the white-hatted
man reaches inside, and gently but firmly disengaging the babe from its
stifling place in the mother&rsquo;s arms, takes it in his own, and out in the
air. The astonished and excited child, partly in fear, partly in satisfaction
at the change, stops its screaming, and as the man adjusts it
more securely to his breast, plants its chubby hands against him, and
pushing off as far as it can, gives a good look squarely in his face; then,
as if satisfied, snuggles down with its head on his neck, and in less than
a minute, is sound and peacefully asleep without another whimper,
utterly fagged out.&rdquo;</p></div>

of the style of this book, he writes of &ldquo;the need of powerful native philosophers
and orators and bards ... as rallying-points to come in times of danger....
For history is long, long, long. Shift and turn the combinations
of the statement as we may, the problem of the future of America is in
certain respects as dark as it is vast. Pride, competition, segregation,
vicious wilfulness, and license beyond example, brood already upon us....
Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and over the roads of our progress,
loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful, threatening gloom. It is useless
to deny it. Democracy grows rankly up the thickest, noxious, deadliest
plants and fruits of all&mdash;brings worse and worse invaders&mdash;needs newer,
larger, stronger, keener compensations and compellers. Our lands embracing
so much (embracing indeed the whole, rejecting none), hold in
their breast that flame also [which is] capable of consuming themselves,
consuming us all.... We sail a dangerous sea of seething currents,
cross and under-currents, vortices&mdash;all so dark, untried&mdash;and whither
shall we turn? It seems as though the Almighty had spread before
this nation charts of imperial destinies, dazzling as the sun, yet with
many a deep intestine difficulty and human aggregate of cankerous
imperfection&mdash;saying, lo! the roads, the only plans of development,
long and varied with all terrible balks and ebullitions.... Behold the
cost, and already specimens of the cost. Thought you, greatness was to
ripen for you like a pear? If you would have greatness, know that you
must conquer it through ages, centuries&mdash;must pay for it with a proportionate
price. Yet I have dreamed, merged in that hidden-tangled
problem of our fate, whose long unravelling stretches mysteriously
through time ... a little or a larger band&mdash;a band of brave and true,
unprecedented yet&mdash;armed and equipped at every point&mdash;the members
separated, it may be, by different dates and States ... but always one,
compact in soul, conscience-serving, God-inculcating, inspired achievers,
not only in literature the greatest art, but in all art&mdash;a new, undying
order, dynasty, from age to age transmitted&mdash;a band, a class, at least as
fit to cope with current years, our dangers, needs, as those who, for their
times, so long, so well, in armour or in cowl, upheld and made illustrious
that far back, feudal, priestly world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Comp. Prose</i>, 246-48; <i>cf.</i> also

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center">ILLNESS</p>


<p class="p2">At the opening of 1873 Whitman had been just ten
years in Washington, and was in the fifty-fourth of
his age. Recent letters to his friends had told of more
frequent spells of partially disabling sickness and lassitude.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
On the evening of Thursday, January 23rd, he
sat late over the fire in the Library of the Treasury
Building, reading Lord Lytton&rsquo;s <i>What will he do with it?</i><a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
As he left, the guard at the door remarked him looking
ill.</p>

<p>His room was close by, just across the street; and he
went to bed as usual. Between three and four in the
morning, he awoke to find that he could move neither
arm nor leg on the left side. Presently he fell asleep
again; and later, as he could not rise, lay on quietly, till
some friends coming in raised the alarm and fetched a
doctor. After some six or seven years of preliminary
symptoms,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Walt had now had a slight stroke of
paralysis.</p>

<p>His first thought was of his mother, to whom he
wrote as soon as he was able, reassuring her; for the
newspapers had exaggerated his condition. Once before,
he reminds her with grim humour, they had killed
him off; but he is on the road to recovery; in a few
days he will be back at his desk on the other side of the
street.</p>

<p>Pete Doyle, Charles Eldridge and John Burroughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
came in to nurse and companion him: Mrs. Ashton
would have carried him to her house; Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor,
who did not share in the estrangement of her husband,
was often at his bedside. And at the bed-foot, his
mother&rsquo;s picture was always before him.</p>

<p>He had scarcely begun to move about a little in his
room before a letter from St. Louis told of the death
of Martha, Jefferson Whitman&rsquo;s wife, to whom the
whole family was much attached, and Walt especially.
The blow fell heavily on him.</p>

<p>On the last day of March,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> he crossed the street again
to his work; and by the end of April he was having
regular electrical treatment, and working for a couple
of hours daily, with an occasional lapse. His leg was
very clumsy, and he complained of frequent sensations
of distress and weakness in his head, but he seemed to
be progressing as well as was possible.</p>

<p>Early in May, however, the old mother in Camden
fell ill. Walt was very anxious about her;<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> at her age
she could hardly recover from a serious illness, and his
letters to her are pathetically full of loving solicitude.
She grew rapidly worse, and although he was still but
feeble, he could not remain away from her. On the
20th he hurried home, and on the 23rd, while he was
with her, she died.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The shock to Walt was terrible; and when, dreading
the heat, he attempted to reach the coast, he had a
serious relapse at the outset, and was brought back to
Colonel Whitman&rsquo;s, to the melancholy little house. And
here he too, so it would seem, was to end his life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Only a year before, in the preface to the reprint of
his Dartmouth College poem,<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> he had declared that
now&mdash;the Four Years&rsquo; War being over, and he himself
having rounded out the poem of the &ldquo;Democratic Man
or Woman&rdquo;&mdash;he was prepared for a new enterprise.
He would now set to work upon fulfilling the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>gramme
of his <i>Democratic Vistas</i>; and put the States
of America hand-in-hand &ldquo;in one unbroken circle
in a chant&rdquo;. He would sing the song for which
America waited, the song of the Republic that is yet
to be.</p>

<p>Again, a year earlier, he had told in his <i>Passage to
India</i> how he was ready to set forth upon the Unknown
Sea.</p>

<p>And now, with his labours unaccomplished, his heart
stricken and heavy with bereavement, joylessly he
seemed to hear the weighing of the anchor and to feel
his ship already setting forth. Where now was the
old exaltation of spirit; where the eager longing for
Divine adventure with which hitherto he had always
contemplated death?</p>

<p>Now sorrow claimed him, and for a season he lost
hold of joy and faith. He was as one abandoned
by the Giver of Life, and isolated from Love. Thus
deserted, he became utterly exhausted of vitality. It is
as though for a time his soul had parted from his bodily
life, and yet the life in the body must go on. If death
had come now he would not have refused it; but his
hour was not yet. Neither living nor dying, through
the sad, dark days of long protracted illness and solitude,
of physical debility and mental bewilderment&mdash;as it were,
through year-long dream-gropings&mdash;he waited.</p>

<p>The light of his life seemed suddenly to have gone
out.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Near as he had dwelt to death, in the tragedy of
the war-hospitals and in the habit of his thought, he
was wholly unprepared for the death of his mother.</p>

<p>He was a man upon whose large harmonious and resonant
nature every tragic experience struck out its
fullest note. Philosophy and religion were his, if they
were any man&rsquo;s; but he was not one of those who
escape experience in the byways of abstraction. He
took each blow full in his breast.</p>

<p>His mother was dead; that was the physical wrench
which crippled him body and soul. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
accustom himself to her death and departure.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> He
could not understand it, nor why he was so stricken by
it. It seemed as though in her life his mother had
given to her son something that was essential to that
soul-consciousness in which he had lived, and that her
death had broken his own life asunder, so that it was no
longer harmonious and triumphant.</p>

<p>His mother was dead, and he was alone in Camden.
Not perhaps actually alone, for his new sister, George&rsquo;s
wife, was always kindly; and so, indeed, was George
himself. But spiritually he was alone. He had lost
something, it seems, of the spiritual companionship which
had made the world a home to him wherever he went.
And now the human comrades who had come so close
were far away. Washington and New York were equally
out of reach; and he had lost O&rsquo;Connor. Letters, indeed,
he had; but they did not make up to him for the
daily magnetic contact with the men and women whom
he loved. Touch and presence meant more to him than
to others, and these he had lost.</p>

<p>He was, then, very much alone; bereft at once, so it
would seem, of the material and the spiritual consciousness
of fellowship; standing wholly by himself, in the
attitude of that live-oak he had once wondered at in
Louisiana, because it uttered joyous leaves of dark
green though it stood solitary.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> He was like a tree
blasted by lightning; yet he too continued to put forth
his leaves one and one, letters of cheery brief words to
his old comrades, and especially to Pete.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> He was an
old campaigner worsted at last, standing silently at
bay; only determined, come what might, that he would
not grumble or complain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His circumstances were not all gloomy. Through the
summer of 1873, Whitman remained with his brother,
at number 322, Stevens Street, in the pleasant room his
mother had occupied upon the first floor. Around him
were the old familiar objects dear to him from childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>He was not wholly house-tied: two lines of street-cars
ran near by,<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> and by means of one or other he
contrived to reach the ferry, which he loved to cross
and cross again, revelling in the swing of the tawny
Delaware, and all the comings and goings of the river
and ocean craft. Hale old captains still remember him
well as he was in those days. Sometimes also he would
extend his jaunt, taking the Market Street cars on the
Philadelphia side of the river, and going as far as the
reading-room of the Mercantile Library upon Tenth
Street.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>But often he was too weak to go abroad for days
together. His brain refused to undertake the task of
leadership or co-ordination, and there was no friend
to assist him. With his lame leg and his giddiness, he
had at the best of times hard work to move about; but
as he wrote to Pete, &ldquo;I put a bold face on, and <i>my best
foot foremost</i>&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>During bad days he sat solitary at home, trying to maintain
a good heart, his whole vitality too depressed to do
more. &ldquo;If I only felt just a little better,&rdquo; he would say,
&ldquo;I should get acquainted with many of the [railroad]
men,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> a class who affected this particular locality. But
feeble as he was, it was long before he made any friends
to replace the lost circle at Washington. Now and again
some kindly soul, hearing that he was ill, would call upon
him:<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> or Jeff would look in on his way to New York, or
Eldridge or Burroughs, coming and going between Washington
and New England.</p>

<p>Walt could not readily adjust himself to his new circumstances.
His was not an elastic, pliable temper; but
on the contrary, very stubborn, and apt to become set in
ways; the qualities of adhesion and inertia increasing
in prominence as his strong will and initiative ebbed.
He kept telling himself between the blurs that disabled
his brain, that he might be in a much more deplorable
fix; that his folks were good to him; that his post was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
kept open for his return, and that his friends were only
waiting to welcome him back to Washington.</p>

<p>But he could not pass by or elude the ever-present
consciousness and problem of his mother&rsquo;s death. At
the end of August he wrote to Pete: &ldquo;I have the feeling
of getting more strength and easier in the head&mdash;something
like what I was before mother&rsquo;s death. (I cannot
be reconciled to that yet: it is the great cloud of my life&mdash;nothing
that ever happened before has had such an effect
on me.)&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> When we remember his separation from the
woman and the children of his love, and all the experiences
of the war, we may a little understand the meaning
of these soberly written words, and the strength of
the tie which bound together mother and son. Who
knows or can estimate the full meaning of that relationship
which begins before birth, and which all the
changes and separations of life and death only deepen?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is difficult to look calmly at this period of Whitman&rsquo;s
life. One resents, perhaps childishly, the fate
which overtook this sane and noble soul. Surely he,
of all men, had been faithful to the inner vision, and
generous to all. He had fulfilled the Divine precept; he
had loved the Lord his God with all the might of soul
and body, and his neighbour as himself. From childhood
up he had been clean and affectionate, independent
and loyal, whole-heartedly obedient to the law as
it was written in his heart, undaunted by any fear or
convention.</p>

<p>He had prized health, and held it sacred, as the essential
basis of freedom and sanity of spirit. And he had
hazarded it without reserve and without fear, in the
infectious and malarial wards of the hospitals.</p>

<p>He had opened his heart to learn the full chords and
meanings of all the emotions that came to him; and
when he had become a scholar in these, he became an
interpreter of the soul unto itself, both in the printed
page and in the relations of his life. In <i>Leaves of Grass</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
he gave, to whosoever would accept the gift, his own
attitude towards life, and the results of his study of
living. In the wards he gave himself in whatever ways
he could contrive to the needy.</p>

<p>And he gave all. Twenty years at least of his own
health he sacrificed, and gave freely, out of the overflow
of his love, to the wounded in their cots. As I have
before suggested,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> he gave more than, physically speaking,
he could afford. But he gave with joy, knowing
that he was born to give, and that in giving himself
irretrievably, he was fulfilling the highest law of his
being, and fully and finally realising himself. It was
the crowning proof not only of &ldquo;Calamus,&rdquo; but of his
gospel of self-realisation.</p>

<p>Deliberate though his service was, not even Whitman
himself could fully estimate the cost of his charity.
But he accepted the consequences of all his acts as
proper and due, being, indeed, implicit in the acts themselves.
And now, when his very joy in life was called in
to meet the mortgage he had given; when he was, as it
were, stripped naked and left in the dark; he accepted
his condition without declaiming against the Divine
justice, or calling insanely upon God.</p>

<p>Year after year, he was patient, expecting the light to
break again, the daylight beyond death. He had never
professed to understand the ways of God, but he had
always trusted Him. And when faith itself seemed for
awhile to forsake him, his blind soul did but sit silently
awaiting its return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was out of such a mood, lighted at times by moments
of vision, that during 1874 and 1875 he wrote some of the
noblest of his verses, notably the &ldquo;Prayer of Columbus,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Song of the Universal,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Song of the
Redwood Tree&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There are those who have suggested that Whitman&rsquo;s
illness was brought on by a life of dissipation; one
supposes that such persons find in these poems the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
death-bed repentance of a maudlin old <i>roué</i>. But to
the unprejudiced reader such a view must appear worse
than absurd. Whitman never claimed to have lived a
blameless life, but he did claim to have lived a sane and
loving one; the evidence of all his writings, and of these
poems especially, supports that claim.</p>

<p>Simple and direct, the &ldquo;Prayer of Columbus&rdquo; breathes
the religious spirit in which it was conceived. Lonely,
poor and paralysed, battered and old, upon the margin
of the great ocean of Death, he pours out his heart and

reiterates his conviction that the Divine is at the heart
of all and every life. The soul will at last emerge from
evil and disease to justify its own history, to bring health

upon American destiny and upon the mystery of death.
The giant of the dense forest, falling before the axes of

that his huge, calm joy will hereafter be incarnate in

this new land of the West&mdash;and, above all, in the Godlike
genius of America. The &ldquo;Song of the Redwood
Tree&rdquo; is the voice of a great past, prophetic of a greater,
all-continuing, all-embracing future, and, therefore, undismayed
at its own passing.</p>

<p>Such were the weapons with which Whitman fought
against despair; such the heroic heart which, amid confusion,
restlessness and perplexity, still held its own.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">COL. WHITMAN&rsquo;S CORNER HOUSE, No. 431, STEVENS STREET, CAMDEN, 1904</p></div>
</div>

<p>At the end of September, 1873, the Whitmans had
moved into a fine new brick house<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> which George, who
was now a prosperous inspector of pipes, had built upon
a corner lot on Stevens Street. It faced south and west,
and Walt chose a sunny room on the second floor, as
we should say, or, according to the American and more
accurate enumeration, on the third. Here he remained
for ten years.</p>

<p>The house still stands, well-built and comfortable;
and though the neighbourhood is shabby and the district
does not improve with time, the trees that stand before
it give it a pleasant air upon a summer&rsquo;s day. Walt was
to have had a commodious room upon the floor below,
specially designed for his comfort and convenience, but
he preferred the other as sunnier and more quiet.</p>

<p>The family now consisted of three only, for Edward,
the imbecile brother, was boarding somewhere near by
in the country. Jeff was in St. Louis, the two sisters
were married, Andrew had died. About Jesse we have
no information; he may still have been living in Long
Island or New York.</p>

<p>More than once Whitman wrote very seriously to
Pete, gently preparing him for the worst;<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> but though
confinement, loneliness and debility of brain and body
made the days and nights dreary, there continued to
be gleams of comfort. John Burroughs had begun to
build his delightful home upon the Hudson, and called
at Camden on his way north, after winding up his
affairs in the capital. Among occasional callers was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
Mr. W. J. Linton, who afterwards drew the portrait for
the Centennial edition of the <i>Leaves</i>. And Walt made the
acquaintance of a jovial Colonel Johnston, at whose house
he would often drink a cup of tea on Sunday afternoons.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>Then, too, the young men at the ferry, and the drivers
and conductors on the cars, came to know and like him,
helping him as he hobbled to and fro.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> He was often
refreshed by the sunsets on the river, and by the winter
crossings through the floating ice;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> while the sound and
sight of the railroad cars crossing West Street, less than
a quarter of a mile away, reminded him constantly of
Pete Doyle, now a baggage-master on the &ldquo;Baltimore
and Potomac&rdquo;.</p>

<p>He had a companion, too, in his little dog,<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> which came
and went with him, and all these pleasant, homely little
matters go to make his letters as cheerful as may be.
If only he could be in his own quarters, and among his
friends, he would be comparatively happy. It is the
home-feeling and affection that he craves all the time;
even a wood-fire would help towards that, but alas,
brother George has installed an improved heater!</p>

<p>About midsummer, 1874, a new Solicitor-General
discharged Whitman from his post at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Hitherto Walt had employed a substitute to carry on his
work. But he had now been ill some eighteen months,
and the prospect of his return was becoming so remote
that he could not feel he had been treated unjustly.</p>

<p>From this time forward his financial position became
precarious. The amount of his savings grew less and
less, and his earnings were not large. Besides beginning
to edit his hospital memoranda for publication,
he wrote for the papers and magazines whenever his
head allowed him to do so; and in England, as well as
at home, there was still some demand for his book.
But even the scanty sales-money did not always reach
him, being retained by more than one agent who regarded
the author&rsquo;s life as practically at an end.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center">CONVALESCENCE</p>


<p class="p2">All through 1875 the weakness continued; but in
November he was well enough to pay a visit to
Washington, accompanied by John Burroughs; and, the
public re-burial of Poe taking place about that time in
Baltimore, Doyle appears to have convoyed him thither.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
There, sitting silently on the platform at the public
function, he seems once again to have been cordially
greeted by Emerson, but O&rsquo;Connor, who was also
present, made no sign.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not till the following summer that Whitman&rsquo;s
old spirits began to return. Since his mother died he
had passed three years in the valley of the shadow, and
he was still lonely, sick and poor when his English
friends came to his rescue.</p>

<p>He and his writings had been pulverised between the
heavy millstones of Mr. Peter Bayne&rsquo;s adjectives in
the <i>Contemporary Review</i> for the month of December.
In England, as well as in America, he had literary
enemies in high places. But on the 13th of March
the <i>Daily News</i><a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> published a long and characteristically
fervid letter, full of generous feeling, from Mr. Robert
Buchanan, who dilated upon the old poet&rsquo;s isolation,
neglect and poverty. It aroused wide comment, and
some indignation on both sides of the Atlantic, among
Whitman&rsquo;s friends as well as among his enemies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span></p>
<p>That he was never deserted by his faithful American
friends a series of articles upon his condition, published
in the Springfield (Mass.) <i>Republican</i>, bears witness.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
But Buchanan&rsquo;s letter evoked new and widespread
sympathy, which was the means of saving Whitman
from his melancholy plight. A fortnight later the
<i>Athenæum</i> printed his short sonnet-like poem, &ldquo;The
Man-o&rsquo;-War Bird&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Rossetti, always faithful to his
friend, had learned of his condition, and had written
asking how best his English admirers might offer him
assistance. Walt wrote in reply, stating that his
savings were exhausted, that he had been cheated by
his New York agents, and that in consequence he
was now, for the new Centennial edition, which had
just appeared, his own sole publisher.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> If any of his
English friends desired to help him, they could best
do so by the purchase of the book. He wrote with
affectionate gratitude, and quiet dignity. He was poor,
but he was not in want.</p>

<p>There came, through Mr. Rossetti, an immediate,
generous and most cordial response, and in the list of
English and Irish subscribers appear many illustrious
names. The invalid revived; &ldquo;both the cash and the
emotional cheer,&rdquo; he wrote at a later time, &ldquo;were deep
medicine&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> He could now afford to overlook the bitter
and contemptuous attacks which were being made upon
him by an old acquaintance in the editorials of the <i>New
York Tribune</i>.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> And, which was at least equally important,
he could contrive to take a country holiday.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About the end of April, or early in May, he drove out
through the gently undulating dairy lands and the fields
of young corn to the New Jersey hamlet of Whitehorse,
some ten miles down the turnpike which leads to
Atlantic City and Cape May.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> A little beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>
village, and close to the Reading Railroad, there still
stands an old farmhouse, then tenanted by Mr. George
Stafford, and to-day the centre of a group of pleasant
villas known as Laurel Springs.</p>

<p>It was here that Whitman lodged, establishing
cordial relations with the whole Stafford family, relations
which added greatly to the happiness of his
remaining years. He became especially attached to
Mrs. Stafford, who intuitively read his moods,<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> and to
her son Harry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A short stroll down the green lane, which is now
being rapidly civilised out of that delightful category,
brings one to a wide woody hollow, where amid the
trees a long creek or stream winds down to a large mill-pool
with boats and lily leaves floating upon it. Save
for the boats and the people from the villas, the place
has been but little changed by the quarter of a century
which has elapsed since Whitman first visited it.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The
walnut and the oak under which he used to sit among
the meadow-grass are older trees, of course, and the
former is now circled with a wooden seat; but the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: keks">kecks</span>
and crickets, the shady nooks by the pool, the jewel-weed
and the great-winged tawny butterflies are there
as of old. And with them much of the old, sweet, communicative
quiet.</p>

<p>At the creek-head, among the willows, is a swampy
tangle of mint and calamus, reeds and cresses, white
boneset and orange fragile jewel-weed, and above, from
its mouth in the steep bank, gushes the &ldquo;crystal spring&rdquo;
whose soft, clinking murmur soothed the old man many
a summer&rsquo;s day.</p>

<p>Here, early and late, he would sit or saunter through
the glinting glimmering lights, and here Mother-Nature
took him, an orphan, to her breast. The baby and boyhood
days in the lanes and fields at West Hills, and
among the woods and orchards came back to him and
blessed him with significant memories. To outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
seeming an old man, and near sixty as years go, in
heart he was still and always a child. And for the last
three years a broken-hearted, motherless child. He had
been starving to death for lack of the daily ministry of
Love.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">TIMBER CREEK: &ldquo;CRYSTAL SPRING&rdquo; AND THE OLD MARL-PIT, 1904</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Timber Creek, by the pool and in the lanes, the
touch of that all-embracing Love which pervades the
universe was upon him. Without any effort on his part
the caressing air and sunshine re-established the ancient
relationship of love, in which of old he had been united
to Nature. He would sit silent for hours, wrapt in a
sort of trance, realising the mystery of the Whole,
through which, as through a body, the currents of life
flow and pulse. Woe to any one, however dear, who
broke suddenly in upon his solitude!<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>His heart went out to the tall poplars and the upright
cedars with their tasselled fruit, and he felt virtue flow
from them to him in return. He believed the old dryad
stories, and became himself truly nympholeptic, and
aware of presences in the woods. In August, 1877, he
writes: &ldquo;I have been almost two years, off and on,
without drugs and medicines, and daily in the open air.
Last summer I found a particularly secluded little dell
off one side by my creek, originally a large dug-out
marl-pit, now abandoned, filled with bushes, trees, grass,
a group of willows, a straggling bank and a spring of
delicious water running right through the middle of it,
with two or three little cascades. Here I retreated
every hot day, and follow it up this summer. Here I
realise the meaning of that old fellow who said he was
seldom less alone than when alone. Never before did I
come so close to Nature, never before did she come so
close to me. By old habit I pencilled down from time
to time almost automatically, moods, sights, hours, tints
and outlines on the spot.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Unlike the ordinary naturalist he regarded the birds
and trees, the dragon-flies and grey squirrels, the oak-trees
and the breeze that sang among their leaves, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
spirits; strange, but kindred with his own, members
together with his of a transcendental life; and he communed
with them. Something, he felt sure, they interchanged;
something passed between them.</p>

<p>Their mystical fellowship had its ritual, as have all
religions. The place was sacred, and he did off, not
only his shoes, but all his raiment, giving back himself
to naked Mother-Nature, naked as he was born of her.
In the solitude, among the bare-limbed gracious trees
and the clear-flowing water, he enjoyed many a sun-bath,
and on hot summer days, in his bird-haunted
nook, many a bathing in the spring; many a wrestle,
too, with strong young hickory sapling or beech bough,
conscious, as they wrestled together, of new life flowing
into his veins.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>Whatever ignorance of names his Washington acquaintance
may have discovered,<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> his diary at this time
is full of nature-lore. It enumerates some forty kinds
of birds, and he was evidently familiar with nearly as
many sorts of trees and shrubs; while differentiating
accurately enough between the sundry trilling insects,
locusts, grasshoppers, crickets and katydids which populate
the district, vibrant by day and night. Doubtless
he had learnt much from the companionship of John
Burroughs, but he was himself an accurate observer.</p>

<p>The story of his visits to Timber Creek and its vicinity
from 1876 to 1882 is told in <i>Specimen Days</i>, with much
else beside&mdash;a book to carry with one on any holiday,
or to make a holiday in the midst of city work. It is,
for the rest, an admirable illustration of the saying of
the philosopher-emperor, that virtue is a living and
enthusiastic sympathy with Nature.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three years of gradual convalescence were divided
not only between the Stafford&rsquo;s farm and the house on
Stevens Street, but also with the homes of other friends
whose love now began to enrich his life.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Of three of the
most notable among his new comrades we must speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
in passing. In the autumn of 1876 Anne Gilchrist took
a house in Philadelphia, while in the following summer
Dr. Bucke and Mr. Edward Carpenter came to Camden
on pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Whitman often said in his later years that his best
friends had been women, and that of his women friends
Mrs. Gilchrist was the nearest. She was an Essex girl
of good family, nine years younger than Whitman.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> At
school she had loved Emerson, Rousseau, Comte and
Ruskin, and a little later she added to them the writings
of Carlyle, Guyot and Herbert Spencer. Music and
science, with the philosophical suggestions which spring
from the discoveries of science, were her chief interests.</p>

<p>At twenty-three she married Alexander Gilchrist, an
art-critic and interpreter. It was a wholly happy marriage;
Anne became the mother of four children, and,
beside being deeply interested in her husband&rsquo;s work,
contrived to contribute scientific articles to the magazines.</p>

<p>While compiling his well-known <i>Life of Blake</i>, Mr.
Gilchrist fell a victim to scarlet fever. His widow, with
her four young children and the uncompleted book, removed
to a cottage in the country, and there, with the
encouragement and help of the Rossetti brothers, she
finished her husband&rsquo;s task. Her life was now, as she
said, &ldquo;up hill all the way,&rdquo; but the book helped her.
And her close study of Blake, added to her scientific
interests and her love of music, formed the finest
possible introduction to her subsequent reading of
Whitman.</p>

<p>Her task was concluded in 1863; it had tided her
over the first two years of her bereavement; but her
letters of sympathy to Dante Rossetti, heart-broken at
the loss of his young wife, discover her gnawing sorrow
yet undulled by time. Like Whitman, she had the capacity
for great suffering. And like Whitman, too, she
was helped in her sorrow by the companionship of
Nature. And, again, she was a good comrade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>Unlike her grandmother, who was one of Romney&rsquo;s
beauties, Anne Gilchrist was not a handsome woman;
but her personality was both vivid and profound, and
increasingly attractive as the years passed. She was
so serious and eager in temperament that, even in
London, she lived in comparative retirement.</p>

<p>The letters which she exchanged with the Rossettis
during a long period are evidence both of her common-sense
and her capacity for passionate sympathy. They
are often as frank as they are noble; revealing a nature
too profound to be continually considerate of criticism.
This gives to some of her utterances a half naïve and
wholly charming quality, which cannot have been absent
from her personality, and must have endeared her to the
comrades whom she honoured with her confidence.</p>

<p>This high seriousness of hers made her the readier to
appreciate a poet who, almost alone among Americans,
has bared his man&rsquo;s heart to his readers, careless of
the cheap ridicule of those smart-witted cynics whom
modern education and modern morality have multiplied
till they are almost as numerous as the sands of the sea.
She was a little more than forty when she first read
<i>Leaves of Grass</i> and wrote those letters to W. M. Rossetti
in which she attested her appreciation of their purpose
and power.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>It was no light thing for a woman to publish such a
declaration of faith; and in her own phrase,<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> she felt
herself a second Lady Godiva, going in the daylight
down the public way, naked, not in body but in soul,
for the good cause. She was convinced that her ride
was necessary; for men would remain blind to the glory
of Whitman&rsquo;s message until a woman dared the shame
and held its glory up to them. And what she did, she
did less for men than for their wives and mothers,
upon whom the shadow of their shame-in-themselves
had fallen.</p>

<p>Mr. Rossetti has described<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> her as a woman of good
port, in fullest possession of herself, never fidgetty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
never taken unawares; warm-hearted and courageous,
with full, dark, liquid eyes, which were at the same time
alive with humour and vivacity, quick to detect every
kind of humbug, but wholly free from cynicism. Her
face was not only expressive of her character, but &ldquo;full
charged with some message&rdquo; which her lips seemed
ever about to utter. Her considerable intellectual force
was in happy harmony with her domestic qualities, and
filled her home-life with interest.</p>

<p>Such was the woman who, in November, 1876, at the
age of forty-eight, brought her family to Philadelphia, in
order that one of the daughters might study medicine at
Girard College; and in whose home, near the college
grounds, Whitman henceforward, for two or three years,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
spent a considerable part of his time. The relationship
of these two noble souls seems to have been comparable
with that which united Michael Angelo and Vittoria
Colonna, and they were at a similar time of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This, the Centennial year, was filled with thoughts and
celebrations of American independence; among which
we may recall the Exposition in Philadelphia&mdash;where
throughout the summer, Whitman had been a frequent
visitor&mdash;and the Centennial edition of his works. He
had also celebrated the occasion by sitting for his bust
to a young sculptor, in an improvised studio on Chestnut
Street. The weather was too hot for a coat; and
in his white shirt sleeves he would, at the artist&rsquo;s request,
read his poems aloud with naïve delight, which rose to a
climax when the sound of applause from a group of young
fellows on the stairs without, crowned his efforts. &ldquo;So
you like it, do you?&rdquo; he cried to them; &ldquo;well, I rather
enjoyed that myself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>The old sad and solitary inertia was broken. Ill
though he often was, the lonely little upper room held
him no longer; nor was he any more shut up within the
sense of bereavement. Jeff had come over from St.
Louis, and his two daughters spent the autumn with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
their aunt and uncles in Stevens Street. All through
the winter Walt was moving back and forward between
George&rsquo;s house, the Staffords farm, and Mrs. Gilchrist&rsquo;s.
He was cheerfully busy with the orders for his pair of
handsome books, which were selling briskly at a guinea
a volume.</p>

<p><i>Leaves of Grass</i> had been reprinted from the plates of
the fifth edition. Its companion, <i>Two Rivulets</i>, was a
&ldquo;mélange&rdquo; compounded of additional poems, including
&ldquo;Passage to India,&rdquo; and the prose writings of which we
have already spoken, printed at various times during
the last five years. &ldquo;Specimen Days&rdquo; was not among
them, and did not appear till 1882. The title <i>Two Rivulets</i>
suggests the double thread of its theme, the destiny of
the nation and of the individual, American politics and
that mystery of immortal life which we call death. They
were not far asunder in Whitman&rsquo;s thought.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>At the end of February, Mr. Burroughs met Walt at
Mrs. Gilchrist&rsquo;s, and thence they set out together for
New York. Here, Whitman stayed with his new and
dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Johnston;<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> and presented
himself in his own becoming garb at the grand
full-dress receptions which were held in his honour;
the applause which greeted him, and the atmosphere of
real affection by which he was surrounded, compensating
him for the always distasteful attentions of a lionising
public, eager for any sensation.</p>

<p>He renewed also, and with perhaps more unmitigated
satisfaction, his acquaintance with the men on the East
River ferries, and the Broadway stages; and, finally, he
ascended the Hudson to stay awhile with John Burroughs.
This pleasant holiday jaunt was not without
its tragic element; his friend, Mrs. Johnston, dying
suddenly on his last evening in New York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in May that Mr. Edward Carpenter visited
him in Camden. After a brilliant Cambridge career, he
was now a pioneer University Extension lecturer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
natural sciences. But besides, or rather beyond this, a
poet, in whom the sense of fellowship and unity was
already becoming dominant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 526px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">EDWARD CARPENTER AT FORTY-THREE</p></div>
</div>

<p>In a note to his just-published preface, Whitman had
spoken of the &ldquo;terrible, irrepressible yearning&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> for
sympathy which underlay his work, and by which he
claimed the personal affection of such readers as he
could truly call his own. This also was the aim which
underlay Mr. Carpenter&rsquo;s first book of verses, <i>Narcissus
and Other Poems</i>, published in 1873.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>Their author was already familiar with <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,
which he had first read at about the age of twenty-five,
and which he had since been absorbing, much as he
absorbed the sonatas of Beethoven. They fed within
him the life of something which was still but dimly
conscious; something dumb, blind and irrational, but
of titanic power to disturb the even tenor of an academic
life. One remarks that both Mrs. Gilchrist and he shared
to the full the modern feeling for science and its philosophy,
and for music.</p>

<p>When he visited Whitman, Edward Carpenter was
thirty-three; it was not till four years after this that he
gave himself up to the writing of his own &ldquo;Leaves,&rdquo;
coming into his spiritual kingdom a little later in life
than did Walt. In many respects his nature, and consequently
his work which is the outcome and true
expression of his personality, was in striking contrast
with that of his great old friend. Lithe and slender in
figure, he was subtle also and fine in the whole temper
of his mind; sharing with Addington Symonds that
tendency to over-fineness, that touch of morbid subtilty
which demands for its balance a very sweet and strenuous
soul, such indeed, as is revealed in the pages of <i>Towards
Democracy</i>.</p>

<p>He found Whitman&rsquo;s mind clear and unclouded after
the suffering of the last four years, his perception keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
as ever.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Courteous, and possessed of great personal
charm, he was yet elemental and &ldquo;Adamic&rdquo; in character.
He impressed his visitor with a threefold personality:
first, the magnetic, effluent, radiant spirit of the
man going out to greet and embrace all; then, the
spacious breadth of his soul, and the remoteness of
those further portions in which his consciousness
seemed often to be dwelling; and afterwards, the
terrible majesty, as of judgment unveiled in him, a
Jove-like presence full of thunder.</p>

<p>This last element in his nature was naked, ominous,
immovable as a granite rock. When once you perceived
it, there was, as Miss Gilchrist has remarked,<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> no shelter
from the terrible blaze of his personality. But this
rocky masculine Ego was wedded in him with a gentle
almost motherly affection, which found expression in
certain caressing tones of his widely modulated voice.
While, to complete alike the masculine and feminine,
was the child&mdash;the attitude of reverent wonder toward
the world.</p>

<p>By turns then, a wistful child, a charming loving
woman, an untamed terrible truth-compelling man,
Whitman seems to have both bewitched and baffled
his young English visitor.</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter saw him at Stevens Street and Timber
Creek, and again under Mrs. Gilchrist&rsquo;s hospitable roof.
They sat out together in the pleasant Philadelphia
fashion through the warm June evenings upon the
porch steps; and Walt would talk in his deliberate
way of Japan and China, or of the Eastern literatures.
He liked to join hands while he talked, communicating
more, perhaps, of himself, and understanding his companion
better, by touch than by words. His mere presence
was sufficient to redeem the commonplace.</p>

<p>His visitor had also an opportunity of noting the efficiency
of Whitman&rsquo;s defences against the globe-trotting
interview-hunting type of American woman. His
silence became aggressive, and her words rebounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
from it; he had disappeared into his rock-faced solitude
where nothing could reach him. And a very few moments
of this treatment sufficed, even for the brazen-armoured
amazon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During Mr. Carpenter&rsquo;s visit, Mrs. George Whitman,
whom Dr. Bucke has described as an attractive, sweet
woman, was out of health, and her brother-in-law made
a daily excursion down town and across the ferry to
see her, and to transact his own affairs. In the heat
of the following July she first opened the door to Dr.
Bucke.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>He, too, had long been a student of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, a
student at first against his own judgment, and with
little result beyond an annoying bewilderment to his
sense of fitness, and of exasperation to his intelligence.
But from the first, he felt a singular interior compulsion
to read the book, which he could not at all understand.
Its lack of all definite statement was the head and front
of its offending to a keen scientific mind. But now
after many years, he had come to recognise the extraordinary
power of suggestion which was embodied in
every page.</p>

<p>Dr. R. Maurice Bucke&rsquo;s personality was strongly
marked and striking; he had as much determination as
had Whitman himself, and his whole face is full of
resolute purpose.</p>

<p>Born in Norfolk, in 1837, but immediately transplanted
to Canada, he was thoroughly educated by his
father, who was a man of considerable scholarship and
a minister in the Church of England.</p>

<p>In 1857, he crowned an adventurous youth passed in
the mining regions of the Western States, by a daring
winter expedition over the Sierras, in which he was so
badly frozen that he afterwards lost both feet, but his
tall and vigorous figure showed hardly a trace of this
misfortune.</p>

<p>Returning to Canada, he studied medicine; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
eventually, in 1877, became the head of a large insane
asylum at London, Ontario. Here he introduced several
notable reforms in the treatment of the patients, which
were widely imitated throughout America.</p>

<p>He was a keen student of mental pathology, and for
some time before his death was reckoned among the
leading alienists of the continent. Certain interesting
and suggestive studies of the relation which appears to
exist between the so-called sympathetic nervous system
and the moral and emotional nature, but especially his
<i>magnum opus</i>, <i>Cosmic Consciousness</i>, published the year
before his death (1901), reveal the direction of his dominant
interest. From 1877, he was one of Whitman&rsquo;s
closest friends, and became subsequently his principal
biographer.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>In the printed recollections of his first interview with
Whitman,<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Dr. Bucke recalls the exaltation of his mind
produced by it; describing it as a &ldquo;sort of spiritual intoxication,&rdquo;
which remained with him for months, transfiguring
his new friend into more than mortal stature.
It is another instance of the almost incredible power of
the invalid&rsquo;s personality.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s own jottings and records of the period
testify to his increasing physical vigour. He goes, for
instance, to the Walnut Street Theatre, to a performance
of Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s <i>The Danites</i>, accompanied by
his friend the author.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> In the summer of 1878, and in
the succeeding year, he is again a guest both of John
Burroughs and of J. H. Johnston.<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> On the second occasion,
he had delivered his lecture on the &ldquo;Death of Lincoln&rdquo;
in the Steck Hall, New York; promising himself
anew, that if health permitted, he would even now set
forth on the lecture tour which he had so long contemplated.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
But though, in the autumn, he made, with
several friends, an extended tour of some sixteen weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
beyond the Mississippi, he did not accomplish this
cherished scheme.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At night on the 10th of September, Whitman and his
party left Philadelphia, westward bound. Walt delighted
in the magic speed and comfort of the Pullman;<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
in which, lying awake among the sleepers, he was
whirled all through the first night up the broad pastoral
valley of the Susquehanna, curving with its thousand
reedy aits about thick-wooded steeps; and on, over ridge
and ridge of the Alleghanies, till morning found them
at smoking Pittsburg.</p>

<p>Crossing the Ohio, almost at the point whence he had
descended it thirty years before on that fateful southern
journey, the good engine, the Baldwin, hurried them all
that day through rich and populous Ohio and Indiana.
Whitman was not disinclined to acknowledge a personality
in the fierce and beautiful locomotive which he had
already celebrated in a poem full of fire and of the modern
spirit.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>They were due next morning at St. Louis, but about
nightfall their headlong flight through the broad lands
was arrested. The Baldwin ran foul of some obstacle,
and suffered serious damage and consequent delay.
Spending the third night in the city, they continued
through a beautiful autumn day, across the rolling
prairies of Missouri, feasting their eyes upon the wide
farmlands full of the promise of bread for millions of
men.</p>

<p>Nor material bread only. There is something in the
vast aerial spaces of these prairie states, their great skies
and lonely stretches, which exalts and feeds the soul;
something oceanic, Whitman thought, &ldquo;and beautiful
as dreams&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Central in the continent, this country
had always seemed to him to correspond with certain
central qualities in his ideal America, and to supply the
background for the two men whose figures stood out
supremely above the struggle for the union, Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
and Grant&mdash;men of unplumbed and inarticulate depths
of character, and of native freedom of spirit and elemental
originality of thought.</p>

<p>Whitman stayed for a while with friends upon the
road, at Lawrence and Topeka. Many of the boys he
had tended in the wards were now hale men out West,
and they were always eager for sight of him; so that
there were few places in America where he would not
have found a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>He proceeded along the yellow Kansas River, through
the Golden Belt, and over the Colorado table-lands, bare
and vast as some immense Salisbury Plain, to Denver.
In that young city he spent several days, dreaming his
great dreams of a Western town that should be full of
friends and strong for and against the whole world,
breathing her fine air, sparkling as champagne and clear
as cold spring water; falling in love with her people
and her horses, and the little mountain streams which
ran along the channel ways of her broad streets.</p>

<p>Thence, he made short trips into the Rockies; where
the railroad winds among fantastic yellow buttes with
steep sloping screes, and towering battlements; and
the trains swing eagerly round a thousand curves to
follow the bronze and amber path-finder, brawling in its
sinuous ravine between the pinnacled, red, cloud-topped
crags which it has carved and sundered.</p>

<p>Every break in the walls disclosed Olympian companies
of august peaks against the high blue. Gradually
the way would climb to the summit, its straightness
widening, here and there, into sedgy mountain meadows
closed about by keen-cut granite heights, the perfect
record of laborious ages; and as the day advanced, the
broad and restful light broadened and grew more serene
as it shone afar on chains of snowy peaks.</p>

<p>Here in this tremendous mountain fellowship, with
its shapes at once fantastic and sublime, its solemn joy
and wild imagination, its infinite complex of form and
colour suggesting vast emotions to the soul, Walt
breathed his proper air and recognised the landscape of
his deepest life. &ldquo;I have found the law of my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
poems,&rdquo; he kept saying to himself with increasing conviction,
hour after hour.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Like the lonely mountain
eagle which he watched wheeling leisurely among the
peaks, he was at home in this sternly beautiful, untamed,
unmeasured land.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, he turned East again
from the mining town of Pueblo; leaving the Far West
unseen<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>&mdash;Utah with its Canaanitish glories of intense
lake and naked, ruddy, wrinkled mountains; the great
grey desert of Nevada; and the forest-clad Sierras looking
out across their Californian garden towards the Pacific.
Stopping here and there with his former friends, he
found his way to Jefferson Whitman&rsquo;s home in St.
Louis, and there remained over the year&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>This cosmopolitan Western city,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> planted in the centre
of that vast valley which the Mississippi drains and
waters, and at the heart of the American continent,
was intensely interesting to Whitman. He had an
almost superstitious love for &ldquo;the Father of Waters&rdquo;;
and many a moonlit autumn night he haunted its banks,
its wharves and bridges, fascinated by the sound of the
moving water as the river flowed through the luminous
silence under the eternal stars.</p>

<p>Physically, St. Louis did not suit him: he was ill there
for weeks together; but even so, he was happy in his
own simple, human way. He went twice a week to the
kindergartens, and there, for an hour together, he entertained
the younger pupils with his funny children&rsquo;s
tales.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> After the first moments of strangeness, and
alarm at his size and the whiteness of his hair, nearly
all the children quickly came to love old &ldquo;Kris Kringle&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Father Christmas&rdquo; as they would call him;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> and for
his part, he was as happy among little children as a
young mother.</p>

<p>Early in January, 1880, he returned home. All his
delight in the West, gathered on his first journey up the
Mississippi thirty years before, and since accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
from many sources, notably from the young Western
soldiers he had nursed, had been confirmed by this
visit.</p>

<p>In only one thing was he disappointed. The men
had seemed, to his searching gaze, fit sons of that new
land of possibility; but in the women he had failed to
find the qualifications he was seeking.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Physically and
mentally, he saw them still in bondage to old-world
traditions; instead of originating nobler and more generous
manners, they were imitating the foolish gentility
of the East. Whitman was very exacting in his ideal
of womanhood; and perhaps it was mainly upon the
ladies of the shops and streets that his strictures were
passed; for there are others in that Western world,
who are not far from her whom he has described in
the &ldquo;Song of the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Broadaxe">Broad-axe</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the best-beloved, possessed
of herself, who is strong in her beauty as are
the laws of nature.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After six months at home among his books and his
friends&mdash;to whom at this time he added, at least by
correspondence, Colonel Robert Ingersoll, afterwards a
member of the inner circle&mdash;Whitman set out upon
another journey, in length almost equal to that of the
preceding autumn. Early in June,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> he crossed the
bridge over Niagara on his way to London, Ontario; and
now at his second sight, the significance of that majestic
scene, which thirty years before he would seem to have
missed, was discovered to him.</p>

<p>Staying with Dr. Bucke, he made frequent visits to
the great asylum, with its thousand patients, under the
wise doctor&rsquo;s care. Walt&rsquo;s own family life, with the
tragedy of his youngest brother&rsquo;s incapacity, had made
the melancholy brotherhood of those whom he has
beautifully described as the &ldquo;sacred idiots&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> especially
interesting to him. He attended the religious services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
held in the asylum; joining with those wrecked minds
in a common worship, and seeing the storms of their
lives strangely quieted, as though a Divine love, brooding
over all, had hushed them.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> With many of the patients
he became personally acquainted, and years afterwards
recalled them by name, inquiring affectionately
after their welfare.</p>

<p>Whitman was in better health than usual, and in excellent
spirits. He loved the doctor, was happy and at
home in his household, and on the best of terms with
its younger members. Among the latter, his presence
never checked the natural flow of high spirits, as does
the presence of most grown-up persons: he was always
one of themselves.</p>

<p>This, indeed, was a characteristic of Whitman in whatever
company he was found, from a kindergarten to a
company of &ldquo;publicans and sinners&rdquo;. The spirit of
comradeship identified him with the others, and he was
so profoundly himself that such identification took nothing
away from his own identity. Among the young
people of Dr. Bucke&rsquo;s household his fun and humour
had free and natural expression; as when, for example,
one moonlit evening, he undertook the burial of an
empty wine-bottle, addressing a magniloquent oration
over its last resting-place to the goddess Semele.</p>

<p>He loved to linger at the table, telling stories after
tea; and to recite or read aloud, when the family sat
together in the dusk on the verandah; and sometimes,
too, he would take his turn in singing some well-known
song. For reading aloud, he would often choose some
poem of Tennyson&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; seems to have been his
favourite.</p>

<p>At this time also, in a secluded nook in the grounds,
he read leisurely over to himself, with the satisfaction
which Tennyson&rsquo;s work nearly always gave him, the
newly published <i>De Profundis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> His diary of these
pleasant, refreshing weeks contains many notes of the
thick-starred heavens and the merry birds, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
multitudinous swallows, which would recall to his well-stored
mind the story of Athene and Ulysses&rsquo; return.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His vital force seemed to be almost unimpaired. The
noble calm of his presence, indeed, made him appear even
older than he was; his fine hair was snowy white, and
the high-domed crown which rose through it and grew
higher and nobler with every year, gave him all claims
to reverence.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>But, though at first sight he seemed to be nearer
eighty than sixty years old, and though he was lame
from paralysis, a second glance showed him erect and
without a line of care or of senility upon his face. His
complexion was rosy as a winter pippin, and his cheeks
were full and smooth, for his heart was always young.</p>

<p>His host wished to show him Canada; in which
country he was the more deeply interested through his
settled conviction that it would presently become a part
of the United States. The St. Lawrence and the
Lakes, he always said, cannot remain a frontier-line;
they are and should be recognised as a magnificent
inland water-way, comparable with the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> he set out upon this great
road with his friend. Taking boat at Toronto, they
descended by easy stages, stopping a night or two at
Kingston, Montreal and Quebec, Whitman thoroughly
enjoying all the new scenes and making friends everywhere
on the way. He sat on the fore-deck in the
August sunshine, wrapped in his grey overcoat, wondering
at the grim pagan wildness of the lower St.
Lawrence, nightly watching the Northern Lights, and
appearing on deck before sunrise.</p>

</div>

<p>As they turned up the deep dark Saguenay and
reached the mountain pillars of Eternity and Trinity,
the mystery of northern river and height, with all they
hold of stillness and of storm, communed with him.
He saw infinite power wedded with an ageless peace;
and all, however awful in its sublimity, yet far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
inhospitable to an heroic race of men; nay, by its very
awfulness, inviting and proclaiming the men who shall
dare to dwell therein.</p>

<p>With the people of Canada, as a whole, he was well
pleased. He liked their benevolent care for the weak
and infirm in body and mind; and thought them in
every respect worthy of the destiny which he believed
that he foresaw&mdash;the destiny of citizenship in the Republic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center">THE SECOND BOSTON EDITION</p>


<p class="p2">After a winter in Camden, Philadelphia and the
country, among friends old and new, Whitman
paid his second visit to Boston. The house-tied stationary
years of 1873 to 1876 had been succeeded by a
period of considerable activity, both mental and physical.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April, he gave his lecture on the
&ldquo;Death of Abraham Lincoln,&rdquo; at the Hawthorn Rooms.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
It was the third year of its delivery; on the two previous
occasions it had been read in New York and
Philadelphia; and he purposed thus annually to commemorate
an event which appeared to him as perhaps
the most significant of his time, an event which the
American people could ill afford to forget.</p>

<p>In Whitman&rsquo;s view, as we have noted, the assassination
of the great President had sealed the million
deaths of the war, and cemented, as could nothing else,
the Union for whose sake they had been given. He
believed that future ages would see in it the most
dramatic moment of the victorious struggle of the
nation against slavery. Rarely hereafter, in spite of
increasing feebleness, did he miss the occasion as the
season came round; though it was often with difficulty
that even a small audience could be gathered for the
anniversary.</p>

<p>Among the friends and notables whom he met in
Boston was Longfellow, who had already called on him
in Camden; and Whitman was warm in eulogies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
old poet&rsquo;s courteous manner and personality.<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Something
of the burden of his first prophetic message had
lifted from Walt&rsquo;s shoulders, and with it some of his
wrath against the popular poets of America. He had
consequently become better able to express his sense of
the real value of work like theirs when its secondary
place was recognised.</p>

<p>There were others in Boston whom he also now discovered
for the first time; notably the women of middle
and later life, among whom he rejoiced to find some of
those large, vigorous personalities whose absence he had
lamented in the West.</p>

<p>In earlier days he had been alienated by the academic
and Puritan qualities which still gave its principal colour,
especially when seen from New York, to intellectual
Boston. But both Boston and Whitman had changed&mdash;alike
with the war and with the advance of time; the
provincialism of the former had given place to broader
views, and the nobler identification of New England
with the whole interests of the nation; while the latter
was now able more generously to estimate even New
England&rsquo;s shortcomings, and to recognise among its
people that ardour and yearning for the ideal which
had always been theirs, but warmed now and humanised,
as he thought, by a new joyousness and breadth of
tolerance.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> He felt a sunshine in the streets, which
radiated from the men and women who traversed them.
This effusive ardour of public spirit set him thinking of
Athens in her golden days; and for the first time he,
who had so much of the Greek in his nature, felt himself
at home in Boston.</p>

<p>The visit was also memorable to him because it introduced
him to the works of Millet, and, one may add, to
the emotional significance of painting as an art.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> As I
have before noted, New York only became a centre of
art collections in comparatively recent years; and it
was probably not till Whitman had sat for two hours
before some of the Breton artist&rsquo;s finest studies in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
house of a Bostonian, that he recognised Painting as
the true sister of music and of poetry.</p>

<p>It was fitting that this revelation should have come
to the poet of Democracy from such canvasses as that
of the first &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Watering the Cow&rdquo;.
Surcharged as they are with a primitive emotion new
to modern art, the works of Millet reveal the inner
nature of that great Republican peasant people whom
Whitman always loved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much of the early summer, after his return, was spent
at Glendale, whither the family from Whitehorse had
now removed, Mr. Stafford having taken the store on
the cross-roads, some three or four miles from his old
home. Directly opposite to it there stands a Methodist
chapel, and often on a Sunday morning the young people
would laugh as they heard Walt, in the room above,
angrily banging down his window sash at the first
clanging of the bell. But behind the chapel is a dense
wood, and here he spent many a long, happy day.</p>

<p>The heat of July was, as usual, very trying to him;
and at the end of the month he accompanied Dr. Bucke
on a visit to his old breezy haunts in Long Island.
The farm at West Hills had passed out of the family;
Iredwell Whitman, the last of Walt&rsquo;s uncles to hold it,
seems to have sold out about 1835. In the little burying
ground there is a stone erected to his daughter Mahala,
who died eight years later.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>While in Boston he seems to have received propositions
from the firm of Osgood and Company for the
publication of a definitive edition of the <i>Leaves</i>, and about
the beginning of September, after completing his manuscript
at the home of his friends, Mr. and (the second)
Mrs. Johnston, at Mott Haven, New York,<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> he settled
down in the New England capital to read proofs and to
enjoy himself.</p>

<p>He stayed at the Bullfinch, close to Bowdoin Square,
and frequented the water-side.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Often he would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
the cars which run through South Boston to City Point,
whose pebbly, crescent beach is lapped forever by the
Atlantic ripple. And to this place the lover of Whitman
may well follow, for it holds memories of him.</p>

<p>On a summer&rsquo;s evening, after dark, thousands of young
Bostonians gather under the lamps, laughing and talking
and listening to the band; but, beyond the zone of lights
and mirth and music, one finds oneself at once in a
mystical solitude. A long bridge or pier stretches out
into the bay, terminating in Castle Island and grim Fort
Independence; and wandering out along it, surrounded
in every direction by distant lights, the illuminated dome
of the State House rising afar in the west, and lights
moving to and fro mysteriously upon the water, you
feel the night wind blowing cool across the black gulf of
sea as it carries to you distant sounds of merry-making.
Very far away they seem, thus encircled in mysterious
spaces which are peopled by sea voices and the stars.
The light surf makes upon the shore its constant and delicious
murmur&mdash;&ldquo;death, death, death, death, death&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>&mdash;and
the lights and the noises of life, with all its passing
show, are mysteriously related in that murmur to the
sane, star-lighted silence of eternity.</p>

<p>Whitman walked daily on the Common, watching the
friendly grey squirrels, and becoming acquainted with
each one in turn of the American elms under which he
sat.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> Timber Creek had deepened his knowledge of the
life of trees and little creatures since last he walked
here with Emerson.</p>

<p>Emerson, too, he saw once again. Mr. Sanborn, the
friend at whose trial he had been present on that former
visit,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> took him out through the suburbs and the wooded
country to Concord. It was Indian-summer weather,
and the meadows, that late Saturday afternoon, were
busy and odorous with haymaking; all things spoke
of peace. Emerson came over for the evening to Mr.
Sanborn&rsquo;s house, and the two old friends sat silent in
the midst of the talk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span></p>
<p>Bronson Alcott, who had brought Thoreau to Brooklyn
and had once compared Whitman with Plato,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> was of
the company of illustrious and charming neighbours.
The others talked, but Emerson leaned back in his chair
under the light, a good colour in his old face, and the
familiar keenness; and near by sat Walt, satisfied to
watch him without words.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Sanborns and he went over to dinner.
His place was by Mrs. Emerson, who entertained him
with talk of Thoreau, but though he listened with
interest, most of his attention belonged to his beloved
host. More than ever, if that were possible, did Whitman
lovingly recognise the character of his friend. He
had not always been just to Emerson,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> nor had Emerson
always maintained his first generosity;<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> each had said
of the other words one cannot but regret, but deeper
than such words of partial criticism was the comrade-love
which united them.</p>

<p>In a letter, written immediately after this visit to his
friend Alma Calder, who had recently become the second
Mrs. J. H. Johnston, Whitman wrote: &ldquo;I think Emerson
more significant and <i>glorified</i> in his present condition
than in any of his former days&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>The whole family was present, and sitting quietly
among them Whitman could understand the natural
limitations which his household entailed upon the
philosopher, and acknowledging these, felt the personal
bond stronger than ever. The relation of the two men
had been singular as well as noble, for it was the elder
who had sought the younger out and affectionately acknowledged
him, and through the years that followed the
advances had been made by him.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s attachment to Emerson had been one of
love and reverence for his person, much more than of
intellectual affinity. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he wrote a few years
later to his Boston friend, Mr. W. S. Kennedy, &ldquo;I think
I know B. W. E[merson] better than anybody else knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
him&mdash;and love him in proportion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> The evidence does
not indicate a similar understanding on Emerson&rsquo;s part,
though the love between them was not unequal. To
Emerson, as to Tennyson, Whitman remained &ldquo;a great
big something&rdquo; of undetermined character.</p>

<p>Whitman met many friends, new and old, upon this
visit, but of the old, Thoreau had long been dead; and
the strong, homely sailor&rsquo;s face of Father Taylor drew
Boston no longer to the Seamen&rsquo;s Bethel. Whitman
himself attracted much attention as he sauntered along
among the fashionable shoppers on Washington Street;
tall, erect and noble, one could not pass him without
notice. I have heard a lady tell how, being familiar
with his portraits, she recognised him at once. Seeing
him mount a car she followed, taking a seat where for
several miles she could, without rudeness, study and
enjoy that splendid ruddy face, through which, lamp-like,
there shone and glowed an inner light of spiritual
ecstasy.</p>

<p>And for Whitman himself, those were happy days.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
The paralysis and the other ailments, more or less
serious and painful, by which it had been enforced,
troubled him less than usual. In his little room at
Messrs. Rand &amp; Avery&rsquo;s printing house, or out-of-doors
in the woods with a fallen tree for his table,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> he was
revising the proofs of his <i>Leaves</i> with a deliberation and
particularity worthy of their final form.</p>

<p>For now this singular book, slowly built up through
the continual inspiration, thought and labour of a
quarter of a century, had come to its completion, and
the final plates were to be cast. Or better, we may say
that for the first time it was to be really published, all
other efforts in that direction having been but tentative,
and more or less unsuccessful. Hitherto, despised and
rejected of publishers, it had issued with an innocent
air from strange places, unvouched by any name which
was recognised by the bookselling world. The edition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
of 1860 is the only exception; and almost immediately
after its publication, the enterprising house which guaranteed
it sank into ruins.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></p>

<p>Now at last, the plan of the book had been, as far as
health and strength permitted, brought to completion<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>&mdash;a
plan amended since the previous Boston visit, and
qualified to admit those poems which had since been
written, and at first designed for a supplementary book.
The cargo was filled, and the good ship ready to sail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a visit to the Globe Theatre to see Rossi
in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and a supper with his co-operators,
the printers and proof-readers, whose aid he
was always eager to acknowledge, Whitman set out
again for New York, returning home about the beginning
of November. Late in the same month, the book,
his vessel as he loved to think of it, set out upon its
voyage; but in spite of favourable presages and a happy
commencement, it was soon shrouded about in fog,
which only yielded to a storm.</p>

<p>Some 2,000 copies were sold during the winter, but
early in the New Year (1882)<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> the trouble, which seemed
to have passed over when the Postmaster-General decided
that the book was not so obscene as to be &ldquo;unmailable,&rdquo;
began to threaten anew. The Boston District
Attorney,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> urged by certain agents of the Society
for the Suppression of Vice&mdash;as though, forsooth, vice
could be &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo;!&mdash;objected to the publication,
and demanded the withdrawal of certain passages.</p>

<p>Whitman was hardly surprised. He had discussed
these passages, or a certain number of them, with his
own judgment; and it is possible that Mrs. Gilchrist&rsquo;s
view of them had also appealed to him. In his own
judgment they were right, but he seems to have been
willing to omit five brief items, amounting in all to
nearly a page, from the incriminated &ldquo;Children of
Adam&rdquo; section, if it would save the edition from further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span>
molestation.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> These he suggested might be cut out of
the plates, and replaced by other cancelling lines which
he would substitute. This was early in March.</p>

<p>But the Attorney was not to be so easily satisfied.
He demanded the omission of lines in all parts of the
volume, amounting to a total of eight or ten pages.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
This, Whitman emphatically refused; and as neither
party would give way, Messrs. Osgood, without testing
the case further, threw up their publication on the 9th
of April. Their action was scathingly contrasted with
that of Woodfall, the publisher of the letters of Junius,
and of Mr. Murray, Lord Byron&rsquo;s publisher, by W. D.
O&rsquo;Connor, in a letter to the <i>New York Tribune</i>. His
indignant sense of literary justice had brought him
once more to the side of his old friend, and although
the former cordial relations seem hardly to have been
re-established, the phantasmal but rigid barrier between
them was crumbling away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That Whitman was sorely disappointed by the issue
of the affair, goes without saying, for he had counted
much upon this edition. But District Attorneys and
Societies for the Suppression of Vice were not likely to
daunt him.</p>

<p>Binding a number of copies in green cloth, he issued
them himself; for Messrs. Osgood had made over to
him the printed sheets and plates. At midsummer, he
transferred the latter to a Philadelphia firm&mdash;afterwards
Mr. David McKay&mdash;who immediately brought out an
edition which sold in a single day.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Persecution had,
as usual, assisted the cause, and for some months the
sale continued brisk, bringing Whitman at the year&rsquo;s
end royalties to the amount of nearly £300.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Osgood disaster was not the only menace to
Whitman&rsquo;s slender income during these years. The
plates of the original Boston edition of 1860 were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
extant, having been bought at auction by a somewhat
unscrupulous person, who, in spite of Whitman&rsquo;s protest,
succeeded in putting a number of copies upon the
market.</p>

<p>This affair was already worrying Whitman when he
lay ill at St. Louis, and it was not till just before the
publication of Messrs. Osgood&rsquo;s edition that some sort
of settlement with this Mr. Worthington was effected.
The author seems to have accepted a nominal sum by
way of royalty,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and was dissuaded from seeking the
legal redress for which at first he had hoped. The
surreptitious sale of this spurious edition was, however,
continued till his death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i286.jpg" width="800" height="465" alt="Picture of Glendale Store, 1904." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">GLENDALE STORE, 1904: WHITMAN OCCUPIED ONE OF THE ROOMS LOOKING OUT OVER THE VERANDAH</p></div>
</div>

<p>Much of the winter of 1881 to 1882 had been spent
at Glendale; and during the following autumn he was
busy with the proofs of <i>Specimen Days and Collect</i>, a
volume of about the same size as the <i>Leaves</i>, and similar
in appearance, which embraced the bulk of his prose
writings up to that time, including a selection from the
early tales and sketches. The plan of separation
adopted in the Centennial edition, in which the supplementary
volume consisted of both prose and verse, was
now abandoned, and the whole of Whitman&rsquo;s verse&mdash;with
the exception of rejected passages which are
numerous&mdash;was re-arranged and fitted together into
the enlarged scheme of the <i>Leaves</i>.</p>

<p>This new arrangement is not without interest. First
comes the prefatory section intended to prepare the
reader, and to indicate the character of the book&mdash;it
belongs largely, in order of time, to the later, more
explanatory period. There follows the original poem,
now known as &ldquo;The Song of Myself,&rdquo; with its assertion
of the Divine and final Me&mdash;the inherent purpose and
personality of the All&mdash;and its gospel of Self-Realisation.
After this we have the poems of Sex&mdash;life&rsquo;s reproductive
energy&mdash;by which self-assertion is carried out towards
society; and then of comradeship and the social passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
These complete the first section of the book, and, as it
were, bring the individual to his or her majority.
Henceforward he is a man and citizen.</p>

<p>There ensues a group of a dozen powerful poems&mdash;&ldquo;The
Open Road,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Broad-axe&rdquo; and others&mdash;in
which the life of ideal American manhood is celebrated,
and the conception of America and her needs becomes
more and more complete. In &ldquo;Birds of Passage,&rdquo; the
loins are girded for noble perils, and here the middle of
the volume is reached. There follows, &ldquo;Sea-Drift&rdquo;
and &ldquo;By the Road-side&rdquo;; the former, a group of poems
contemplative, in middle life, of the mysteries of bereavement
and of death; the latter, full of questions, doubts
and warnings, leading up to the &ldquo;Drum-taps,&rdquo; poems
of war, of national consciousness and of political destiny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Autumn Rivulets&rdquo; are discursive and peaceful after
the storm; they introduce a group, including &ldquo;The
Passage to India,&rdquo; in which the unity of the world is
emphasised, a unity which is declared simultaneously
by Whitman with the utterance of his thoughts of
death. In &ldquo;Whispers of Heavenly Death,&rdquo; he gives
expression to many moods, to insurgent doubts and to
triumphant faith. They are followed by an Indian-summer
of miscellaneous poems, &ldquo;From Noon to Starry
Night,&rdquo; and the volume closes with the &ldquo;Songs of
Parting,&rdquo; and the identical words which in 1860 he had
set at the end.</p>

<p>There is little new in the book beyond the arrangement,
and careful and final revision and readjustment of
all the items to the unity of the whole. The main lines
of the edition of 1860 are still followed; but since that
version, most of the political poems have been added, and
many of those which sing of battle and of death, with
a considerable mass of the explanatory and philosophical
material natural to later life.</p>

<p>All this has necessarily qualified the earlier work, and
has made the task of revision and adjustment necessary.
For Whitman had a profound sense of congruity and
character, and his alterations were dictated by his original
purpose of creating a book which his own soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>
might forever joyfully acknowledge and attest, and even
perhaps in future ages continue.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> The book was his
body, projected, out of his deepest realisation of himself,
into type and paper, and it changed somewhat in all
its parts as it grew to completion and became more
perfect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="center">AMONG THE PROPHETS</p>


<p class="p2">With the completion of the main body of his work,
and before we pass to the details of his last
years in Camden, a brief digression into wider fields
may perhaps be permissible. For Whitman&rsquo;s thought,
though it is very consciously his, is interestingly related
to that of the preceding century and of his own, and no
study of him would be at all complete which left this
fact out of consideration. Readers who prefer to follow
the path of events will find it again in the next chapter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While it is difficult to imagine a greater contrast than
that between the Essayist on Man and the Singer of
Myself, they were at least agreed as to the proper subject
for human study.</p>

<p>Physically they were most dissimilar&mdash;Pope, a little,
deformed, ivory-faced wit, all nerves and eyes; Whitman,
a huge, high-complexioned, phlegmatic peasant-artisan.
Between their thought lay the century of
Rousseau, Goethe and Hegel, of Washington, Robespierre
and Napoleon. And their mental contrast was
as marked as their physical. It is clearly indicated in
the formal character of their work: Pope&rsquo;s, a mosaic of
brilliant couplets; Whitman&rsquo;s, a choral or symphonic
movement.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>Wholly lacking in the intellectual dazzle of the
Augustan wits, Whitman&rsquo;s strength lay rather in those
naturalistically romantic regions of the imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
world which in the eighteenth century were being rediscovered
by certain provincial singers, the forerunners
of the Lake-poets. In the verses of Scottish poets from
Ramsay to Burns; in Macpherson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ossian,&rdquo; and,
finally, in the work of two men who were Londoners
but &ldquo;with a difference&rdquo;&mdash;the soul-revealing cries of
Cowper and the lyric abandonment of Blake&mdash;there was
restored to English poetry that emotional quality which
had been banned and ousted by the self-conscious club-men
of the eighteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<p>Just as the passion of high conviction returns to
English politics with Burke, and to English religion
with Wesley, so it finds expression once again in the
rhythmical impulse of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> and the <i>Songs of
Innocence</i>. There is here a new feeling for beauty, a
new sense of the emotional significance of Nature.</p>

<p>With the return of that enthusiasm based upon conviction,
which the sceptical Deism of Pope abhorred,
there came a more elastic use of metre. For the movement
of poetry should vary as the pulse varies under
emotion. Passion now took the place of logic in the
guidance of the rhythm of thought. And as the spirit
of the poet lay open to the stars, his ear caught new and
ever subtler rhythms, and became aware that every impelling
motive for song has its own perfect and inalienable
movement. His attention passed from current
standards and patterns to those windy stellar melodies
unheard by the town-bred Augustan ear. All this, with
much more, is revealed in the work of the new poets,
from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley to Tennyson.</p>

<p>When Whitman came, his spirit was aware of this
newly apprehended canon of poetic form. At first, he
tried the medium of rhymed verses; but his were
without inspiration. When self-expression became
imperative he abandoned them.</p>

<p>For the poet, nothing can be more important than the
emotional atmosphere which his verses create, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
is conveying rather moods than fancies, inspirations
of the soul rather than thoughts of the intelligence.
Eventually, it is the poet&rsquo;s own personality or attitude
of mind that most affects the world; and it seemed to
Whitman that this must communicate itself through the
medium of his thoughts by their rhythm or pulse of
speech and phrasing. The manner of speaking means
more almost than the matter spoken, because it is by
the manner, and not by the thought, that the speaker&rsquo;s
attitude toward life is most intimately conveyed.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that there are rhythms which
suggest and evoke gladness and exaltation; others which
call forth melancholy; others which predispose to lascivious
passions, and so forth: the thought is older than
Plato. Whitman wished to convey to his readers all
that I have attempted to describe in the foregoing pages;
his own attitude towards life, that of a fearless, proud,
abysmal, sympathetic, wholesome man. And he found
no medium among those in current use which seemed
to him effective for his purpose.</p>

<p>He had to go back to the prophets of Israel, and the
rhythm into which their message was put anew by the
seventeenth century translators, to find a model. It
was from them, and from a study of the movements of
prose, but especially of speech, that he came to his own
singular, and not inappropriate style. At the last definition,
the appeal of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> is intended to be
that of an intimate kind of speech. It would be interesting,
in this connection, to compare Whitman&rsquo;s
manner with that of the other writers of his period who
have most distressed the purists&mdash;Browning, Carlyle,
Emerson and Meredith&mdash;but that field is too large for
us to enter now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Addington Symonds once said<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> that Whitman had
influenced him even more deeply than Plato; and the
juxtaposition of the two names is as singular as it is
suggestive. For while the &ldquo;arrogant Mannhattanese&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>
is far indeed from the founder of the Academy, there is
something essentially Platonic in Whitman&rsquo;s attitude
toward poetry. For Whitman was a moralist in the
highest sense. With Plato, he dreamed always of the
Republic, and that dream was the moving passion of
his life.</p>

<p>He would&mdash;at least in his earlier years&mdash;have said
with Plato, in his <i>Laws</i>, &ldquo;The legislator and the poet
are rivals, and the latter can only be tolerated if his
words are in harmony with the laws of the State&rdquo;. But
over the last phrase he would have laughed, adding, In
my Republic the citizens think lightly of the laws!</p>

<p>Like Plato, he accused all the poets whom he loved
best of an essential hostility to the Republic. Their
whole attitude implied an aristocratic spirit, which discovered
itself in their rhythms, and struck at the life
of America. He would only admit such poets as are in
harmony with the spirit of the Republic, and interpret
the genius of America.</p>

<p>It was for America, then, that he made his chants;
chanting them, as he hoped, in such fashion that they
might forever nerve new soldiers for the battle which
he saw her destined to maintain through all the ages
against the ancient tyrannies of the past.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If one were to seek among modern writers for those
whose genius is related to Whitman&rsquo;s, one would, I suppose,
name first Rousseau, with his moody self-consciousness,
his great social enthusiasm, his religious fervour,
and his passionate perception of beauty in Nature.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> And
then, after Goethe, to whom I have several times referred
in passing, one would add Byron, that audacious
egoist, who, threatening the Almighty like some Miltonic
Lucifer, fascinated the gaze of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>But Whitman had almost nothing either of the morbid
sentiment or dramatic skill of the French reformer,
nor had he Byron&rsquo;s theatrical and somewhat futile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
rhetoric of rebellion. He was indeed very much at
peace with the cosmos; his confessions are frank, but
impersonal; his egoism may be Satanic in its pride, but
then for him, Satan, though he remains in opposition,
is really an essential factor in the government of the
worlds. Temperamentally he was nearer to George
Sand;<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> and, on at least one side of his nature, to
Victor Hugo.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is rather as a prophet than as a literary figure that
we must compare him with his great contemporaries.
On this side, he was obviously related to Millet, to
Beethoven and to Wagner&mdash;but it seems simpler
roughly to set him over against several men of his own
craft who hold a European reputation&mdash;to Carlyle,
Mazzini, Emerson, Morris, Browning, Tolstoi and
Nietzsche.</p>

<p>With Whitman, Carlyle<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> recognised the underlying
moral purpose of the universe, and the organic unity or
solidarity of mankind; but being himself a Calvinistic
Jacobin of irritable nerves, these convictions filled him,
not with a joyful wonder and faith, but with contempt
and despair. He never saw humanity as the body of a
Divine and Godlike soul; and though he was continually
calling men to duty and repentance, he did so from
inward necessity rather than with any anticipation of
success. For he felt himself to be a Voice crying in
the wilderness. Whitman worshipped the hero as
truly as did Carlyle; but then he saw the heroic in
the heart of our common humanity, where Carlyle
missed it; hence his appeal was one of confidence, not
despair.</p>

<p>For Mazzini, the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; was not a scourge
but a magician&rsquo;s wand, because he believed.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The
Italian was not, like Carlyle, an iconoclast, but a messenger
of good tidings; and if he carried a sword, it
was in the name of the Prince of Peace. Like Whit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span>man,
he was conscious of the world-life pulsing through
him; in himself he found the peremptory spirit of the
Republic demanding from him both blood and brain.
Like Whitman also, he looked to a comradeship of
young men for the regeneration of his nation; and to a
poet to come for the great words which alone can unite
men and nations, creating the world anew in the image
of Humanity. For them both, religion was the ultimate
word&mdash;a religion free from the shackles of dogma, free
in the spirit of the Whole&mdash;and it was a word which the
world could only receive from the poets that are to be.
But while thus similar in their aspirations, they were
very different in temper and circumstances. For
Mazzini was a fiery, nervous martyr to his cause, a
Dantesque exile from the land of his love. And yet his
appeal, at least in his writings, is not so intimate as is
that of the less vehement apostle of liberty.</p>

<p>With Emerson,<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> whose relationship to Whitman I
have already discussed, there is the great contrast of temperament.
For in him, passion seems to have played but
little part. He is one of the noblest of those constitutional
Protestants and individualists who are incapable
of feeling the fuller tides of the catholic passion of social
sympathy. His earnest and profound spirit seems to
dwell forever in the sunny cloisters of a thoughtful
solitude, far distant from life&rsquo;s rough and tumble.</p>

<p>Browning&rsquo;s belief that the immanent Divinity finds
expression through passion, and is lost in all suppression
of life;<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> and his faith in the universal plan, which includes
the worst with the best, relate his thought to
Whitman&rsquo;s. For them both, each individual life contains
a part of the divine secret. It is the concrete
personality of things which they seek to express, though
in very different ways.</p>

<p>Browning astonished Carlyle by his confident cheerfulness.
And his optimism was founded upon knowledge,
or at least did not depend upon ignorance.
Though he believed in the triumph of the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
element in every soul&mdash;the element of love&mdash;he recognised
the reality of evil, and saw life as a battle.</p>

<p>But not as a battle between the body and the soul, or
between vice and virtue: the conflict, for Browning as
for Whitman, is ultimately between love as the inmost
spirit of life, and all other virtues and vices whatsoever.
Love alone &ldquo;leaves completion in the soul,&rdquo; and solves
the enigmas of doubt.</p>

<p>Browning&rsquo;s conception of a Democracy, in which all
men should &ldquo;be equal in full-blown powers,&rdquo; and God
should cease to make great men, because the average
man would have become great, was set forth in some
of the earliest work of a genius as precocious in its
development as that of his master Shelley.</p>

<p>But it would be easy to exaggerate the relationship
which I have indicated. For Browning was a cosmopolitan
and delightful gentleman, who in his later years
cultivated music and studied yellow parchments and the
freaks of human nature, in a Venetian palace; while
Whitman was sauntering through old age in the suburb
of an American city, appearing by comparison uneducated,
uncouth and provincial. Appearance is, however,
deceptive, for the earth Walt smacks of is the autochthonous
red soil of the creation of all things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tolstoi, aristocrat as he is by birth and education, is
yet a peasant in his physical and spiritual character;
a Russian peasant, with the moujik&rsquo;s almost Oriental
stubbornness of resignation and passivity. Like Whitman,
he is one of the people, and in some respects
he is an incarnation of Russia, as Whitman was of
America. But while there are many obvious relations
between the two men, their contrast is the more striking.
Tolstoi has the Oriental tendency towards pessimism
and asceticism. He sees the body and spirit in irreconcilable
conflict. And similarly he opposes forever pleasure
and duty; so that his is a message of the endless
sacrifice of self.</p>

<p>An abyss of terror surrounds him, from which he
can only escape by a life of resolute and loving self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>devotion.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
His gospel is one of escape, and is in many
respects nearer in spirit to Carlyle&rsquo;s than to Whitman&rsquo;s.
Tolstoi&rsquo;s detestation of the State is, doubtless, largely
traceable to the military despotism under which he has
lived.</p>

<p>There is a certain element of pessimism also, in the
attitude of William Morris, as of Ruskin his master.
But though he flings back the Golden Age into the
thirteenth century, his gospel is really one of actual joy.
When the citizen finds pleasure in his daily work, the
State will prosper; such is his promise for the future, and
his condemnation of the present. Carlyle urged men to
work, in order to kill doubt, and silence the terrible questions;
but Morris finds that the questions are really
answered by work, if only it is done in the spirit of the
artist, and in fellowship with others.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Like Whitman, Morris was one who seemed to his
friends almost terribly self-sufficing; he could stand
alone, they thought. But strong as he seemed in his
solitude, he was the poet of fellowship, of a fellowship
which is man&rsquo;s fulfilment and immortal life. Though
Whitman&rsquo;s view of that life was more philosophical,
and his personality had a more mystical depth, the two
men had much in common, especially in the aggressive
and elemental masculinity of their character, and their
superb joy and pride in themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would be interesting to compare Whitman&rsquo;s general
position with that of Nietzsche; that most perplexing
figure of young Germany in revolt from Hegel and all
the past, from the restraint, system and conventions
which threaten the liberty of the individual spirit. But
Nietzsche is difficult to summarise; and time has not
yet given us the perspective in which alone the general
forms of his thought will become evident.</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that he expresses that spirit of
rebellion which was so marked a feature of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
<i>Leaves of Grass</i>; a rebellion against all bondage, even
though it call itself virtue and morality. And this, be
it remembered, was always a part of the real Whitman;
it was the side of the <i>Square Deific</i> which he has aptly
named &ldquo;Satan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Between Nietzsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;overman,&rdquo; jealous of every tittle
of his identity, and always a law unto himself, refusing
to bow his neck to the virtues and vices of the &ldquo;weaker
brother&rdquo;; and Whitman&rsquo;s self-asserting Ego, there is
the same striking resemblance. One can never omit
the dogma of the sacredness of self-assertion, with the
criticism of Christianity which it involves, from any
statement of Whitman&rsquo;s position. He evidently detested
that plausible levelling argument, so potent for mischief
to the race-life which it professes to guard&mdash;that one
must be always considering the effects of example
upon the foolish and perverse, and endeavouring to live
down to their folly and perversity, instead of up to
the level of true comradeship. Be yourself, say Whitman
and Nietzsche, and do not waste your life trying
to be what you fancy for the sake of other people you
ought to be.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s doctrine of equality is again really not unlike
Nietzsche&rsquo;s doctrine of inequality; for it only asserts
the equality of individuals because of the overman latent
in each one; and is different enough from the undistinguishing
equalitarianism of popular philosophy.</p>

<p>But Whitman had the balancing qualities which
Nietzsche lacked. As he said once to Mr. Pearsall
Smith: &ldquo;I am physically ballasted so strong with
weightiest animality and appetites, or I should go off in
a balloon&rdquo;. In his case, self-assertion was not associated
with mania; for it never snapped those ties of
comradeship and love which keep men human, but
became instead a bond for fuller and nobler relations
with men and women.</p>

<p>The comparison with Nietzsche suggests the limits of
Whitman&rsquo;s Hegelianism. For though he once declared
that he &ldquo;rated Hegel as Humanity&rsquo;s chiefest teacher
and the choicest loved physician of my mind and soul&rdquo;;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
and again, that his teaching was the undercurrent which
fructified his views of life,<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> yet it may well be doubted
whether he ever really mastered the full Hegelian theory,
or realised the futility of many of those generalisations
in which German idealism has been so prolific. It was
because Hegel saw life, both the Me and the Not Me, as
a single Whole, and found a place for evil in his world-purpose,
that Whitman hailed him as the one truly
&ldquo;American&rdquo; thinker of the age. But in the individualism
of Nietzsche is the partial corrective of Hegel&rsquo;s
position; and as I have suggested, Whitman would have
accepted it as such.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps the foregoing very rough and ready comparisons
may have thrown some light on the outstanding
features of Whitman&rsquo;s personal message and
influence. But there remains another, which I have
already suggested, and to which for a moment we must
return.</p>

<p>Whitman was essentially a prophet-mystic, and while
he derived nothing from most of the men with whom
his thought is related, the indirect influence upon him
of George Fox the Quaker is certain.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>Fox&rsquo;s distinguishing quality was his intense personal
reality; there are few more vivid figures on any page
of history. This seems to be due to the fulness of life
which he realised, and could focus in his actual consciousness.
From this he did not derive &ldquo;advanced
views&rdquo; but vital power. And vital power is equally,
and perhaps in fuller measure, characteristic of Whitman,
manifesting itself by various signs in his daily life,
and in the phrases of his book.</p>

<p>In Whitman, as in Fox, this was an attractive power
of extraordinary force. Around Fox it created a Society
of Friends; and one cannot doubt that sooner or later a
world-wide Fellowship of Comrades will result from the
life-work of Whitman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>Fox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friends&rdquo;&mdash;though the meaning of the title
may originally have been &ldquo;Friends of the Truth&rdquo;&mdash;were
real friends; united in a new ideal of communion. They
shared the highest experience in common; meeting for
the purpose of entering together into &ldquo;the power of the
life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And Whitman also realised that life at its highest is
only revealed to comrades. His view of religion was
even less formal than that of the early Quakers; but he,
too, preferred to sit in silence with those he loved, realising
that Divine power and purpose which was one in
them.</p>

<p>Quakerism has not unfairly been spoken of as a
spiritual aristocracy; there seems to be something
essentially exclusive about it. On the other hand, it
is essentially democratic and would exclude none; but
the methods necessary to its conception of truth do
not appeal to the many.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Fellowship of Whitman&rsquo;s Comrades
must be an aristocracy of overmen&mdash;if the words can
be divested of all sinister association and read in their
most literal sense.</p>

<p>Whitman recognised that his inner teachings could
only be accepted by the few, and for them he set them
forth. But for the many also, he had a message. And
though the actual comrades of Whitman must be able
to rise to his breadth of view and depth of purpose, that
purpose embraces the whole world.</p>

<p>For the possibility of Comradeship is implicit in every
soul; and there is none&mdash;no, not the most foolish or
perverted or conventionally good&mdash;who is ultimately
incapable of entering into it. The fellowship must be
as essentially attractive as was the personality of Whitman
himself; and if few should be chosen to be its
members, yet all would be called.</p>

<p>Once realised as the one end of all individual and
social life, such a Comradeship would transform our
institutions and theories whether of ethics, politics, education
or religion. In a word, it would change life into
a fine art. For it could be no Utopian theory, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
most practicable of gospels. The seed has been already
sown, and we may now await with confidence the
growth of a tree through whose branches all the stars
of faith will yet shine, and in whose embracing roots
all the rocks of science will be held together.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="center">HE BECOMES A HOUSEHOLDER</p>


<p class="p2">Emerson and Longfellow died within six months
of Whitman&rsquo;s Boston visit; the former being
buried in that graveyard at Sleepy Hollow where Walt
had so recently stood by the green mounds that mark
the resting-places of Hawthorne and of Thoreau.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
Carlyle had died a year earlier; Carlyle who so deeply
impressed his impetuous pathetic personality upon all
that he handled, and who was one of the principal
literary influences upon Whitman during his later years,
as Emerson had doubtless been an inspiration in the
earlier. And while Walt had been working on the Osgood
proof-sheets, James Garfield, the friend who used to
hail him as he passed on Pennsylvania Avenue riding
with Pete Doyle, shouting out some tag from the
<i>Leaves</i>, and who had now become President of the
United States, died amid the mourning of the nation.</p>

<p>Whitman&rsquo;s daily life had been poorer these last two
or three years, since Mrs. Gilchrist&rsquo;s return to England,
but new friends were continually added to his circle.
Among these was Mr. W. S. Kennedy, who was working
for awhile on one of the Philadelphia papers, and has
since published a notable collection of reminiscences and
memoranda of his relations with the Camden poet.</p>

<p>The Christmas of 1882<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> brought him a delightful
gift in the friendship of a Quaker family. Mr. Pearsall
Smith was a wealthy Philadelphia glass merchant, who
with his wife had, till recently, been a member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span>
Society of Friends. He had had a remarkable career as
an evangelist, both in his own country and in Europe; his
eloquence and magnetic personality having been instrumental
in changing the course of many lives. His wife
also was an active worker in the fields of religion and
philanthropy; and their home in Germantown&mdash;one of
the suburbs of Philadelphia most remote in every sense
from plebeian Camden&mdash;became a meeting-place for men
and women interested and engaged in the work of reform.
By this time, however, Mr. Pearsall Smith himself,
finding in human nature more forces than were
accounted for in the evangelical philosophy, had withdrawn
from active participation in its labours.</p>

<p>The elder of his daughters, Miss Mary Whitall Smith,
a thoughtful and enthusiastic college girl, came back
from New England, where she was studying, fired by a
determination to meet Walt Whitman. Her parents
discovered with dismay that she had read the <i>Leaves</i>,
at first with the consternation proper to her Quaker training,
but later with ardour. Respectable Philadelphians,
and especially members of the Society of Friends, were
disposed to regard the poet as an outrageous, dangerous
person, who lived in a low place, among disreputable
and vulgar associates. His works were classed by them
with the wares of obscene book-vendors, as absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p>The parents&rsquo; consternation at their daughter&rsquo;s resolve
may well be imagined. But being wise parents, they
were prepared to learn; and Mr. Smith eventually drove
her over in a stylish carriage behind a pair of excellent
horses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MARY WHITALL SMITH (MRS. BERENSON) IN 1884</p></div>
</div>

<p>They found Whitman at home. He descended slowly,
leaning on his stick, to the little stuffy parlour where
they were waiting; and with a kindly, affectionate amusement
received the girl&rsquo;s homage. Her father immediately
and impulsively asked the old man to drive back
and spend the night with them. This was the spontaneous
kind of hospitality which most delighted Walt,
and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, in which he weighed
the matter, he decided in favour of his new friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
their excellent equipage. His sister-in-law quickly
produced the boots and other necessaries, and they set
forth. Whitman loved to drive and to be driven, and as
he sat on the back seat by his adoring young friend,
he heartily enjoyed the whole situation. It was indeed
enough to warm an old man&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>After listening to her avowals, he recommended Miss
Smith to study Emerson and Thoreau, but was evidently
well pleased with her praise. Genuine devotion he
always accepted.</p>

<p>He stayed a couple of days on this occasion; delighting
in long drives along the Wissahickon Creek, and
showing himself very much at home among the young
people of the household.</p>

<p>From this time on, and until the family left for England
in 1886, he was their frequent visitor; and in
later years&mdash;while reverently remembering Mrs. Gilchrist,
who died in 1885&mdash;he came to speak of Mary
Whitall Smith as his &ldquo;staunchest living woman friend&rdquo;.
His letters to her father also are evidences of a close
intimacy between the two men. Thus it seems permissible
to speak here at greater length than usual of their
relations, which serve besides to illustrate others not
less affectionate.</p>

<p>Often during the college vacations, when the house
was filled with merry young folk, Whitman would sit
in the hall to catch the sounds of their laughter, enhanced
by a little distance; or from his corner, leaning
upon his stick, he would look on for hours together
while they danced. Spirits ran high on these occasions,
and all the higher for his smiling presence. He
enjoyed everything, and not least the wholesome incipient
love-making which he was quick to notice, and
encourage.</p>

<p>Often he was full of fun; and still, as in the old days,
he sang gaily as he splashed about in his bath, a delighted
group of young people listening on the landing
without to the strains of &ldquo;Old Jim Crow,&rdquo; some Methodist
hymn, or negro melody. At night, before retiring,
he would take a walk under the stars, sometimes alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
sometimes with his girl friend, who could appreciate the
companionableness of silence.</p>

<p>He was always perfectly frank, as well as perfectly
courteous; if he preferred solitude he said so; and if,
when at table, his hostess proposed to read aloud some
long family letter, and asked him in an aside whether
he would like to hear it, he would smile and answer, No.</p>

<p>He came to see them usually in his familiar grey
suit; but in winter he wore one of heavier make, which
was, however, provided with an overcoat only; indoors,
he then put on the knitted cardigan jacket seen in some
of his portraits. On one occasion, when some local
literary people were invited to meet him, he appeared
unaccustomedly conscious of his clothes. Uncomfortable
at the absence of a coat, he tried the overcoat for
awhile; but becoming very hot before the dinner was
done, he beat a retreat into the hall; and there divesting
himself of the burden, returned in his ordinary
comfortable dress. Such incidents admirably illustrate
his simple and homely ways.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Henceforward, though records are multiplied, the
movement of Whitman&rsquo;s life is less and less affected
by outer events, and becomes yearly more private and
elusive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 554px;">
<img src="images/i304.jpg" width="554" height="800" alt="Picture of Whitman at sixty-two." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN AT SIXTY-TWO</p></div>
</div>

<p>There is little to record of 1883, save that shortly
after his sixty-fourth birthday there appeared the biographical
study of Whitman by his Canadian friend.
Like the earlier and smaller sketch by John Burroughs,
Dr. Bucke&rsquo;s volume was revised and authenticated by
the poet, and is an invaluable record. Though fragmentary
and far from exhaustive, it is written by one
of the very few who can be said to have caught the
real significance of the life and personality of the author
of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. That he fully understood Whitman,
neither he nor his poet friend ever suggested; but then
one must add that Whitman always laughingly asserted
he did not by any means understand himself.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span></p>
<p>As a result of the sales of the Philadelphia edition
and the royalties which they brought him, the old man
was now enabled to carry a long-cherished plan into
execution.</p>

<p>On March the 26th, 1884,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> he left his brother&rsquo;s house,
and removed to a little two-story cottage on Mickle
Street, near by. Here he installed himself, at first with
an elderly workman and his wife, and afterwards under
the more efficient <i>régime</i> of Mrs. Mary Davis, a buxom
New Jersey widow of comfortable presence, who brought
into the house that homely atmosphere which Whitman
had so long been seeking.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>Downstairs, in the little front parlour, he carried on
what remained to him of his own publishing&mdash;the old
autograph editions which he had not entrusted to Mr.
McKay; and over it, upstairs, was his bedroom, which
he liked to compare with a big ship&rsquo;s cabin. In the
backyard were lilacs, which he loved; and a shady
tree stood in the side-walk in front.</p>

<p>He found his little &ldquo;shack,&rdquo; as he called it, pleasant
and restful, and his own. He was not much worried
by the rasping church choir and the bells, which
jangled cruelly loud for such sensitive hearing every
Sunday; nor by the neighbourhood of a guano factory,
which was noticeable enough to the most ordinary nose.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
Here his friends from far and near were frequent visitors,
Dr. Bucke, John Burroughs and Peter Doyle among
them; and in June came Edward Carpenter from England
on his second visit.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Carpenter had now issued his slender green <i>Towards
Democracy</i>, that strange, prophetic, intimate book, so
unlike all others, even the <i>Leaves</i> which it most resembles.
It was seven years since the two men had
met, and the older had grown thinner and more weary-looking.
He had not been worsted in the long struggle
with time and illness, but they had left their mark upon
his body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>The visitor renewed his first impressions of that
complex personality; felt again the wistful affection
mingled with the contradictiousobstinacy; recognised
the same watchful caution and keen perception, &ldquo;a
certain artfulness,&rdquo; and the old &ldquo;wild hawk look&rdquo; of
his untameable spirit; but, beneath all, the wonderful
unfathomed tenderness.</p>

<p>Whitman manifestly had his moods, &ldquo;lumpishly immovable&rdquo;
at times, at times deliberately inaccessible.
He took a certain wilful pleasure in denial, for the
quality of &ldquo;cussedness&rdquo; was strong in him. And his
friends admired his magnificent &ldquo;No,&rdquo; issuing from
him naked and unashamed, just as mere acquaintances
dreaded it.</p>

<p>But in other moods he was all generosity, and you
knew in him a man who had given himself body, mind
and spirit to Love, never contented to give less than all.</p>

<p>Among the topics of their conversations was the Labour
Movement, in which Carpenter was actively interested.
Whitman professed his belief in co-operation, at the
same time reiterating his deeply-rooted distrust of
elected persons, of officials and committees. He had
lived in Washington; and besides, his feeling for personal
initiative, his wholesome and passionate love of
individuality, and its expression in every field, set him
always and everywhere against mere delegates and
agents. Above all things, he abhorred regimentation,
officialism and interference. &ldquo;I believe, like Carlyle,
in <i>men</i>,&rdquo; he said with emphasis. He hoped for more
generous, and, as he would say, more prudent, captains
of industry; but he looked for America&rsquo;s realisation to
an ever-increasing class of independent yeomanry, who
should constitute the solid and permanent bulk of the
Republic.</p>

<p>Regarding America from the universal point of view,
as the standard-bearer of Liberty among the nations, he
thought of Free-trade as a moral rather than a merely
economic question. Free-trade and a welcome to all
foreigners were for Whitman integral parts of the
American ideal. &ldquo;The future of the world,&rdquo; he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
say, &ldquo;is one of open communication and solidarity of
all races&rdquo;; and he added, with a dogmatism characteristic
of his people, &ldquo;if that problem [of free interchange]
cannot be solved in America, it cannot be
solved anywhere&rdquo;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In considering Whitman&rsquo;s attitude towards the Social
Problem, and especially the Labour Problem, whose development
in America he had been watching since the
close of the war, one must consider the conditions of
his time and country.<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> The Industrial Revolution,
which is still in progress&mdash;and which in its progress is
changing the face of the globe, disintegrating the old
society down to its very basis in family life&mdash;has revealed
itself to us in the last generation, much more clearly
than to Whitman, who grew up seventy years ago in a
new land.</p>

<p>We can see now that, though it may prelude a reconstruction
of human society and relations in all their
different phases, it is itself destructive rather than constructive.
We recognise that it does not bring equality
of opportunity to all, as its earlier observers had predicted;<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
but that, on the contrary, it destroys much of
the meaning of opportunity; the control of capital
which is the motive power of modern industrial life,
falling more and more into the hands of a small group
of legatees, on whose pleasure the rest of the community
tends to become dependent for its livelihood.</p>

<p>And we see the results of this new economic condition
in the character of the populations of those vast cities
into which the Industrial Revolution is still gathering
the peoples of Europe and America. Among these, the
spirit of individual enterprise and initiative is continually
choked by the narrow range of their opportunity. Their
lives become the melancholy exponents of that theory of
the specialisation of industry against which the humanitarians
of the age have all inveighed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>Serious as it was becoming in the New World, the
Labour Question had not yet, in Whitman&rsquo;s time,
assumed an aspect so menacing as in the Old. Even
to-day the proportion of Americans engaged in agriculture
is four times as large as that which rules in Great
Britain; and except in the North Atlantic States, the
rural population does not seem to be actually losing
ground;<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> though its increase is much less rapid than
that of the urban districts, into which more than a third
of the population is now gathered, as against a fifth at
the close of the war, or an eighth in the middle of the
century. At the time of Whitman&rsquo;s death nearly three-quarters
of the total number of American farmers were
the owners of their farms; and it was in these working
proprietors, with the similar body of half-independent
artisans who were owners of their houses, that he
placed his social faith. These were, as we have seen,
the men whom he regarded as citizens in the fullest
sense.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>In this view he was doubtless influenced by Mill, whose
<i>Principles of Political Economy</i> he seems to have studied
soon after its appearance in 1848. Roughly speaking,
Mill had supplemented the teaching of Adam Smith,
that individual liberty is the one sure foundation for the
wealth of nations, by describing the proper sphere of
social intervention in industrial matters. His picture
of the future industry&mdash;the association of the labourers
themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the
capital with which they carry on their operations, and
working under managers selected and removable by
themselves&mdash;has been quoted as the socialist ideal.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>And Mill was deeply influenced by the early Socialists.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
Their activity in Europe during the first half of the
nineteenth century was so remarkable that it must have
come under the notice of Whitman. Robert Owen, intoxicated
with what was perhaps a rather shallow conception
of the great truth of human perfectibility, had spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
his life and wealth in unsuccessful but most suggestive
social experiments. No less optimistic were his French
contemporaries, St. Simon and Fourier.</p>

<p>In striking contrast with them and their doctrinaire
systems, Proudhon, the peasant, who presents not a few
points of agreement with Whitman, looked forward to
voluntarism as the final form of society, and detested
alike the theoretic elaboration and the sexual lubricity
of his amiable but, on the whole, unpractical compatriots.</p>

<p>The failure of the risings of 1848, and the succeeding
period of reaction, checked the socialist movement,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
and social reform was left for awhile to middle-class
Liberalism, with its philanthropic ignorance of the real
needs of the workers; until, in the last generation, the
demands of labour, the pressure of poverty and the
aspirations of social enthusiasts, have together furnished
the motive power for a further struggle for the collectivist
ideal of &ldquo;intelligent happiness and pleasurable
energy&rdquo; for all.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>This recent movement was at first most unequally
yoked with an unbeliever in the brilliant, fatalistic theory
of Karl Marx. Marx was a year older than Whitman;
his acute Hebrew intellect was trained under the Hegelian
system of thought, but he was apparently destitute
of the finer historic sense, as well as of Hegel&rsquo;s idealism.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
The humanitarian character of the social movement is
now once more sweeping it far beyond his formulas;
but in Whitman&rsquo;s time the Marxian theory dominated
Socialism.</p>

<p>In Long Island and New York, during the period of
Whitman&rsquo;s youth, the social condition was, on the
whole, free from serious disorders, save those incident
upon growth and rapid development. The spirit of
Elizabethan enterprise, the practical achievement of
brave and ardently conceived ideas, ruled in that democratic
society wherein his habit of mind was shaped,
and of which it was in large degree a natural product.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
Whitman&rsquo;s youth and early manhood were little touched
by evidences of any social disease so deep-seated as to
encourage ideas of revolution. It is true that the vested
interests of the slave party made themselves felt in New
York; but neither to him nor to the &ldquo;Free-soil&rdquo; party
did the anti-slavery movement suggest that other change
which the political title they adopted brings so vividly
before the mind to-day. &ldquo;Free-soil&rdquo; had for him no
definitely Socialistic significance.</p>

<p>And it was only, as we have seen, after the war that
the accentuation of the labour problem brought it into
prominence in the American cities. Whenever, thereafter,
Whitman, leaving the comparative quiet of his
own surroundings, revisited the metropolis, or wandered
to some great western centre of industry, he realised
dimly the progressive approach of the crisis.</p>

<p>The increase in the accumulation of wealth was far
outrunning even the rapid increase in population; but
a large proportion of this wealth was being concentrated
in a few hands which threatened to control the national
policy. Manufacture was facilitated by the immense
influx of immigrants who swelled the dependent city
populations, and these immigrants coming more and
more from the south-east of Europe, that is to say, from
the most backward, ignorant and turbulent nations,
promised by their presence to create a social problem
in the North and Middle West not less acute if less extensive
than that of the negro in the South.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Democracy looks with suspicion on the very poor,<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
quoth Whitman, meaning that the poverty of the poor
incapacitates them for citizenship. That, I think, is
one of the great and final arguments against the policy
of <i>laissez faire</i> under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>Things would go very well if left to themselves, says
the philosophic theorist, and so even Whitman is often
inclined to declare.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> But just as the organised party of
slavery, in the fifty years before the war, refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
leave things to right themselves, so the party of property
to-day interferes, more or less unconsciously, with the
principle which it so loudly proclaims. It is because of
the existence of innumerable sacrosanct parchments,
customs and traditions, and all the subtly clinging fingers
of mortmain, that <i>laissez faire</i> remains an empty phrase.
If we could burn the parchments and loose the fingers,
men might go free. But still for the sake of the nation&rsquo;s
health the poor would need to be assisted to rise out of
the helpless condition into which society has allowed
them to be thrust and held.</p>

<p>We have noted Whitman&rsquo;s hearty approval of Canada&rsquo;s
benevolent institutions for the incapable; he fully recognised
the duty of society toward such as these.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> And
however hesitating his declarations on a subject which
he was willing to leave to younger men, the main principle
of his social economy, the right of each individual
to be well born, carries us far from the policy of any
party dominant to-day in our political life.</p>

<p>He recognised this right as far more fundamental
than any secondary privilege which has been accorded
to property for social convenience. And it is because
this right continues to be denied to millions of future
citizens, to the most serious peril of the whole Republic,
and apparently for no better reason than that its recognition
must impede the present rate of increase in
material development, that the Socialist party has arisen
in America. It is safe to say that it is the only party
which deliberately aims at social amelioration and the
equal opportunity of all citizens; and in this respect it
seeks to realise Whitman&rsquo;s ideal. In so far, however,
as it clings to European theories, and identifies itself
solely with a section of the nation, proclaiming a class-war
in the interests, not of America or of Humanity,
but of Labour&mdash;large, and inclusive as the term may
be&mdash;it seems directly to antagonise that ideal.</p>

<p>Whitman would certainly be belied by the label of
&ldquo;Socialist&rdquo;; but &ldquo;Individualist&rdquo; would as little de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span>scribe
him. He was, and must always remain, outside
of parties, and to some extent in actual antagonism to
them; for while recognising its purpose and necessity,
he was essentially jealous of government and control.
He wanted to see the Americans managing their own
affairs as little as possible by deputy, and, as far as possible,
in their own persons. That, I take it, is the only
form of collectivism or social life which is ultimately
desirable; and all political reform will aim at its practical
realisation. It depends most of all upon the simultaneous
deepening of social consciousness and sympathy
and increase of the means and spirit of individual independence.
Only by these simultaneous developments
can we hope to see established that Society of Comrades
which was the America of Whitman&rsquo;s vision.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the practical side of the Labour Question the old
man occasionally expressed his emphatic dislike of certain
sides of Trade Unionism, and probably misunderstood,
as he clearly mistrusted the movement. &ldquo;When
the Labour agitation,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;is other than a
kicking of somebody else out to let myself in, I shall
warm up to it, maybe.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> And of the workman he added:
&ldquo;He should make his cause the cause of the manliness
of all men; that assured, every effort he may make is
all right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But he was a poor man himself, judged by modern
standards, and he had a profoundly human and practical
sympathy with the lives of the poor. He knew exactly
where their shoe pinched. And thus, whatever his dislike
of Unionism, he was an admirable administrator of
charity. His delight in giving made him the willing
almoner of at least one wealthy Philadelphia magnate,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
and during severe winters he was enabled to supply his
friends, the drivers of the street cars, with warm overcoats.
In his diary, alongside of the addresses of those
who purchased his books, are long lists of these driver
friends, dimly reminiscent of the hospital lists which he
used to keep in Washington.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span></p>
<p>Walt was always an incurable giver of gifts, and
these, one may be sure, never weakened the manly
independence of their recipients. His admiration for
generous men of wealth, like George Peabody, has found
a place in <i>Leaves of Grass</i>.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> For he saw that to love is
both to give and to receive, and in that holy commerce
both actions alike are blessed.</p>

<p>His interest in social work is shown in a hitherto unpublished
letter written about this time to Mary Whitall
Smith, who had married and gone to England, and
who sent him accounts of the work being done among
the poor of the East End through the agency of Toynbee
Hall. Of this he writes at noon on the 20th of July,
1885: &ldquo;The account of the Toynbee Hall doings and
chat [is] deeply interesting to me. I think much of all
genuine efforts of the human emotions, the soul and
bodily and intellectual powers, to exploit themselves for
humanity&rsquo;s good: the <i>efforts</i> in themselves I mean (sometimes
I am not sure but <i>they</i> are the main matter)&mdash;without
stopping to calculate whether the investment
is tip-top in a business or statistical point of view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These libations, ecstatic life-pourings as it were of
precious wine or <i>rose-water</i> on vast desert-sands or great
polluted river&mdash;taking chances for returns <i>or no returns</i>&mdash;what
were they (or are they) but the theory and practice
of the beautiful God Christ? or of all Divine personality?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="center">AT MICKLE STREET</p>


<p class="p2">The presidential election of the autumn of 1884
brought the long Republican <i>régime</i> to an end.
During the twenty-four years of its continuance the old
party cries had become almost meaningless, and the
parties themselves ineffective, while political life had
grown increasingly corrupt from top to bottom.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> The
only practical demand of the hour was for a good government,
and this required a change of party. Whitman,
with a number of independent Republicans known as
&ldquo;Mugwumps,&rdquo; supported the Democrat, Mr. Grover
Cleveland. With his return to the White House the
South may be said to have returned to the Union, after
a generation of bitter estrangement.</p>

<p>In the following summer Whitman had a slight sun-stroke,
which rendered walking much more difficult.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
For several months he was a good deal confined to his
little house, but his friends promptly came to the rescue
with a horse and light American waggon.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<p>He was overcome with gratitude for the gift&mdash;driving,
as we have seen, was one of his delights&mdash;and he promptly
began to make full use of his new toy. He soon disposed
of the quiet steed, thoughtfully provided, and substituted
one of quicker paces, which he drove furiously along the
country roads at any pace up to eighteen miles an hour.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
Rapid movement brought him exhilaration, and he displayed
admirable nerve upon emergency.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">FAC-SIMILE OF PORTION OF LETTER FROM WHITMAN TO THE LATE
MR. R. PEARSALL SMITH, MAR. 4, 1884</p></div>
</div>

<p>Though he was getting old, his capacity for enjoyment
was as great as ever. He enjoyed everything,
especially now that at sixty-five he was, for the first
time in his life, a householder; he enjoyed his quarters,
his friends, his food, and in a grim way his very suffering.
&ldquo;Astonishing what one can stand when put to one&rsquo;s
trumps,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> he wrote on a black day. While he could
rattle along the roads in his waggon, he was naturally
happy enough, and he encouraged all opportunities for
pleasure. He enjoyed his food, and he now relaxed
some of the stricter rules of temperance which hitherto
he had followed.</p>

<p>During periods of his life, as a young man and through
the years at Washington, he was practically a total
abstainer, and till he was sixty he only drank an
occasional toddy, punch, or glass of beer. After that
he followed the doctor&rsquo;s advice and his own taste, enjoying
the native American wines, and at a later period,
champagne.</p>

<p>Stories of heavy drinking were circulated by the
gossips, and were tracked at last to the habits of a
local artist, who imitated Whitman in his garb, and
somewhat resembled him.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Walt&rsquo;s head was remarkably
steady, and it need hardly be said that he was
always most jealous of anything which could dispute
with him his self-control.</p>

<p>In 1885 and several subsequent years<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> a popular
caterer on the river-side, a mile or two below Camden,
opened the summer season, about the end of April, with
a dinner to some of his patrons, and Whitman was one
of those who did fullest justice to his planked shad and
champagne. For the latter he would smilingly admit
an &ldquo;incidental weakness&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>His temperance had given him a keen relish for fine
flavours, and he enjoyed all the pleasures of the senses
without disguise, and with a frank, childlike response
to them. This responsiveness, more almost than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
other thing, kept his physical nature supple and young.
His consciousness was never imprisoned in his brain,
among stale memories and thoughts whose freshness
had faded; it was still clean and sensitive to its surroundings,
and found expression in the noticeably fresh,
rich texture of his skin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was well that he should practise these simple
pleasures, for apart from his own ailments, which increased
with time, he was still troubled with financial
difficulties. The purchase of the house had not been
exactly prudent, as it added considerably to his expenses,
and the success of the Philadelphia edition was not long
continued. The royalty receipts soon dwindled to a very
little stream, and his other earnings&mdash;though he was well
paid for such contributions as the magazines accepted,
and was retained on the regular staff of the <i>New York
Herald</i>&mdash;were not large.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>Word went round among his friends, both in America
and in England, that the old man was hard up again,
and a second time there was a hearty response. A fund,
promoted by the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> at the end of 1886,
brought him a New Year&rsquo;s present of £80,<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> and individual
friends on both sides of the sea frequently sent thank-offerings
to him.</p>

<p>Some Boston admirers attempted at this time to
secure for him a Government pension of £60 a year,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
in recognition of his hospital work. But Whitman disliked
the plan, and though it was favourably reported
upon by the Pensions Committee of the House of Representatives,
he wrote gratefully but peremptorily refusing
to become an applicant for such a reward, saying quite
simply, &ldquo;I do not deserve it&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> His services in the
Attorney-General&rsquo;s Department seem to have been adequately
paid, and one is glad the matter was not pressed.
The hospital ministry could not have been remunerated
by an &ldquo;invalid pension&rdquo;; it was given as a free gift,
and now it will always remain so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i317.jpg" width="800" height="563" alt="Picture of Mickle Street, Camden in 1890." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">MICKLE STREET, CAMDEN IN 1890: THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE RIGHT IS WHITMAN&rsquo;S</p></div>
</div>

<p>From time to time special efforts were made by his
friends to remove any immediate pressure of financial
anxiety. Whitman, who was on the one hand generous
to a fault, and on the other not without a pride which
consented with humiliation to receive some of the gifts
bestowed, manifested a boyish delight in money of his
own earning, and it did his friends good to see his merriment
over the dollars taken&mdash;six hundred of them<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>&mdash;at
his Lincoln lecture of 1886 in the Chestnut Street Opera
House. By way of profit-sharing he insisted on presenting
each of the theatre attendants with two dollars.</p>

<p>The repetition of the lecture in New York the following
spring, at the Madison Square Theatre, before a brilliant
company of distinguished people, including Mr. James
Russell Lowell, &ldquo;Mark Twain,&rdquo; Mr. Stedman, and
Whitman&rsquo;s staunch admirer, Mr. Andrew Carnegie,
brought him a similar sum;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> while Colonel Ingersoll&rsquo;s
lecture for his benefit in 1890 was yet more productive,
and the birthday dinners also contributed something to
his funds. But the mention of these financial matters
must not be construed into a pre-occupation with the
subject in the old man&rsquo;s later years; it troubled his
friends far more than it troubled him.</p>

<p>After the gift of the horse and waggon, Mr. W. S.
Kennedy and others planned to provide Whitman with
a cottage at Timber Creek.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The idea delighted him;
he craved for the pure air and the living solitude of the
woods. But his health became too uncertain for the
realisation of the scheme, and the remainder of his
days was spent in Camden.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The little house in quiet, grassy Mickle Street,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
standing modestly between its taller neighbours, with
the brass plate, &ldquo;W. Whitman,&rdquo; on the door, and
the mounting-stone opposite, was becoming a place of
frequent pilgrimage, and it has often been lovingly
described.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span></p>
<p>During the earlier years, Walt&rsquo;s favourite seat was
at the left-hand lower window, and there the children
would call out to him, and he would answer brightly
as they went by to school. The walls and mantel-shelf
were covered with portraits, and as to the books and
papers, so long as he used the room, it was beyond the
wit of any woman to keep them within bounds. But
it was afterwards, when he was more confined to his
bedroom, that they fairly broke loose.</p>

<p>He seems to have enjoyed this native disorder, for
in the big, square, three-windowed upper room they
occupied not only the shelves and chairs and table
but the floor itself. &ldquo;His boots,&rdquo; says a friend&mdash;who,
when Mrs. Davis was out, used to effect an entrance
at the window to save her host descending the stairs&mdash;&ldquo;his
boots would be standing on piles of manuscript on
a chair, a half-empty glass of lemonade or whiskey toddy
on another, his ink-bottle on still another, his hat on
the floor, and the whole room filled with an indescribable
confusion of scraps of paper scrawled over with his big
writing, with newspapers, letters and books. He was
not at all eager to have order restored, and used to
grumble in a good-natured way when I insisted upon
clearing things up a bit for him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>He liked to think and speak of the room as his den or
cabin; it was his own place, and bustling with his own
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Here were his old-time companionable books:
the complete Scott of his youth, and a volume of poets
which he used in the hospitals; his friend Mr. E. C.
Stedman&rsquo;s <i>Library of American Literature</i>; studies of
Spanish and German poets, and Felton&rsquo;s <i>Greece</i>; translations
of Homer, Dante, Omar Khayyam, Hafiz, Saadi;
Mr. Rolleston&rsquo;s <i>Epictetus</i>&mdash;a constant friend&mdash;Marcus
Aurelius and Virgil; with Ossian, Emerson, Tennyson
and Carlyle, and some novels, especially a translation of
George Sand&rsquo;s <i>Consuelo</i>; and last, and best read of all,
Shakespeare and the Bible. The book of Job was
one of his prime favourites in the beloved volume which
was always by him in later years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span></p>
<p>Perilously mingled with the papers was wood for his
stove, over whose crackling warmth he would sit in
the cold weather, ensconced in his great rattan-seated,
broad-armed rocker, with the wolf-skin over it; his
keen scent relishing the odour of oak-wood and of the
printer&rsquo;s ink on the wet proofs which surrounded him.</p>

<p>Visitors usually waited in the room below for his
slow and heavy step upon the stairs. There the canary
sang its best, as though to be caged in Whitman&rsquo;s house
was not confinement after all; and a bunch of fragrant
flowers stood on the window-sill. A kitten romped
about the premises, which were inhabited besides by a
parrot, a robin, and a spotted &ldquo;plum-pudding&rdquo; dog;
not to mention Mrs. Davis, and eventually her two
stepsons. One of these, Warren Fritzinger, who had
been a sailor and three times round the world, afterwards
became Walt&rsquo;s nurse, while his brother Harry
called his first child Walt Whitman, to the old man&rsquo;s
delight.</p>

<p>Among the visitors was a young Japanese journalist,
who afterwards published an amusing but ill-advised
record of their conversations,<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> a document which seems
to the English mind somewhat more injudicious than
other Whitmanite publications, which certainly do not
err on the side of reticence. After his first visit, Mr.
Hartmann maintains that Walt shouted after him,
&ldquo;come again,&rdquo; and this injunction from time to time he
fulfilled, naïvely recording his own desperate attempts
to cope with the long silences which threatened to overwhelm
his forlorn sallies into all conceivable regions of
conversation.</p>

<p>The older man would sit absent-mindedly, replying
with an ejaculation or abruptly clipped phrase, or impossible
sentence; but chiefly with his monosyllabic
&ldquo;Oy! oy?&rdquo; which served, with a slight inflection, for
almost any purpose of response. They say that Whitman
grew garrulous, or at least less laconic, in his old
age;<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> but Mr. Hartmann hardly found him so.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span></p>
<p>One day, when Mrs. Davis was absent, they lunched
together on &ldquo;canned lobster&rdquo; and Californian claret in
the kitchen. The sun shone on the grass in the little
back garden, on the pear-tree half-smothered in its
creeper, and the high boarded fence; and on the hens,
poking in and out through the open door, and recalling
the old farm life at West Hills. Whitman talked of the
West, and of Denver, his queen-city of the West.</p>

<p>Over another similar meal, he declared his love
for the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>, and his distaste for the
gloomy poets from Byron to Poe. They discussed
music among their many topics. Mr. Hartmann declared
himself a Wagnerian, but Whitman confessed
his ignorance of the &ldquo;music of the future&rdquo;; Mendelssohn,
of course, he knew; and in later life he had discovered
Beethoven as a new meaning in music, and had
been carried out of himself, as he says, seeing, absorbing
many wonders.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> But he was brought up on the
Italians; it was from Verdi and his predecessors, interpreted
by Alboni, Bettini and others, that he had learnt
the primal meanings of music, and they always retained
his affection.</p>

<p>About the middle of May,<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> 1887, a sculptor, who had
already studied Whitman in the Centennial year, came
on from Washington to Mickle Street. Mrs. Davis
sided some of the litter in the parlour; and the old man
sat for him there as amiably as ten years before in the
improvised studio on Chestnut Street.</p>

<p>They talked much of the President, on a portrait of
whom Mr. Morse had been working. Whitman had a
high opinion of Mr. Cleveland, and displayed a lively
interest in all the personal details his friend could
supply.</p>

<p>During the sittings Herbert Gilchrist arrived from
England, where his mother had died of a painful disease
some eighteen months earlier; and he set up his easel
also. Callers came from far and near; while dozens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
of children entered with a word or message from the
street, and older folk looked in at the window.</p>

<p>Whitman was not very well even for him, and he
missed his solitude. But he was a delightful and
courteous host. The three men often lunched together,
while several English visitors&mdash;taking Whitman on
their tour even though they missed Niagara<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>&mdash;sat down
to a bite of beef, a piece of apple-pie, and a cup of tea
poured out by the reverend host in the hot little kitchen.</p>

<p>Good Mrs. Davis watched her old charge and friend
with some anxiety, as this constant stream of visitors
flowed in and out; but she herself rose more than
equal to every emergency. She had for lieutenant a
coloured char-woman, born the same day as Whitman,
who felt herself for that reason responsible in no ordinary
degree for the general appearance of the premises.
The sculptor and she often found themselves in conflict.
As for his clay, she disdained it along with the whole
genus of &ldquo;dirt&rdquo;. She succeeded in white-washing the
delightful moss-covered fence, and would, he felt sure,
have liked to treat both him and his work in the same
summary fashion. They debated theological problems
together, to Whitman&rsquo;s amusement, and he would have
it that Aunt Mary came out of these encounters better
than the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does your Satan get work to do,&rdquo; the latter
would ask, &ldquo;if God doeth all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you fear for <i>him</i>,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s allers
a-prowlin&rsquo; around lookin&rsquo; fer a chance when God&rsquo;s back
is turned. There ain&rsquo;t a lazy hair on <i>his</i> head. I wish,&rdquo;
she added significantly, &ldquo;I could say as much for some
others.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>Beside Aunt Mary other characters appear upon the
pages of his friends&rsquo; journals; notably a garrulous,
broad-brimmed Georgian farmer, who had served in the
Confederate army. He was the father of a large family,
which he had brought up on the <i>Leaves</i>. As for himself,
he had the book by heart, and was never so happy as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[Pg 322]</span>
when reciting his favourite passages at Sunday School
treat or Church meeting. He knew Emerson&rsquo;s writings
with almost equal intimacy, but complained that these
set his soul nagging after him, while Whitman&rsquo;s were
soothing to it. With Walt he declared that he loafed
and invited his soul; with Waldo, his soul became importunate
and invited him.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, he admitted, his farm ran more to weeds
than it should. Doubtless, during his pilgrimage the
weeds prospered exceedingly; for he stayed long, and
sad to say, in the end he went away a &ldquo;leetle disappointed&rdquo;.
&ldquo;I have to sit and admire him at a distance,&rdquo;
he complained, &ldquo;about as I did at home before
I came.&rdquo; Walt liked him, and was amused by his talk,
but his advice, his criticism and his interpretations to
boot, were overmuch for a weary man.</p>

<p>There came one day a &ldquo;labour agitator,&rdquo; who required
an introduction or testimonial of some sort from Whitman;
and he also went away disappointed. In answer
to all his loud-flowing, self-satisfied declarations, Whitman
merely ejaculated his occasional colourless monosyllable;
and when at last the discomfited man took his
leave, the poet&rsquo;s absent-minded &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; was more
ludicrously and baldly opportune than intentional.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>Humorous as they appeared at the time, there was
another side to interviews of this character; for it began
to be noised about that Whitman was quite spoilt by his
rich friends, and had lost his interest in and sympathy
with the American working-man. This was due, of
course, to a complete misunderstanding. The old fellow
who lived in his &ldquo;little shack&rdquo; on Mickle Street, and
dined in Germantown in his cardigan jacket, might
have a world-reputation, but he was not forgetful of
the people from among whom he sprang and to whom
he always belonged.</p>

<p>At the same time it is true, as we saw, that he did
not himself profess to understand or to approve the
party organisation of labour. He was rather inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
to sit in his corner and have faith, and to listen to what
the younger men had to say. In any case, he saw no
remedy for present troubles in the exploitation of class
feeling; he could see no help in urging the battle between
two forms of selfishness.</p>

<p>Generosity and manhood were his constant watchwords,
whether for labour or for the nation. No
circumstances, he would say, sitting in his room
broken by the suffering of years, can deprive a hero of
his manhood. But he would add his conviction that
the Republic must be in peril as long as any of her sons
were being forced to the wall, and his wish that each
&ldquo;should have all that is just and best for him&rdquo;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sculptor and his sitter had many a long evening
chat together, the shadows of the passers-by cast by
the street light and moving across the blind. The old
man&rsquo;s mellow and musical, but somewhat uncertain,
voice filled at these times with a confidential charm.</p>

<p>One night he wrote out a tentative statement of his
general views, declaring for Free-trade, and for the
acknowledgment of the full human and political equality
of women with men. He regarded the world as being
too much governed, but he was not against institutions
in the present stage of evolution, for he said that he
looked on the family and upon marriage as the basis of
all permanent social order. He seems to have disliked
and even condemned the practices of the American
Fourierist &ldquo;Free-lovers,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> though Love&rsquo;s real freedom
is always cardinal in his teachings. Anything like a
laxity in fulfilling obligations, but especially the ultimate
obligations of the soul, was abhorrent to him.</p>

<p>He was not a critic of institutions; and he accepted
the work of the churches and of rationalism as alike
valuable to humanity. He added to his statement
various personal details; saying, half-interrogatively,
that he thought if he was to be reported at all, it was
right that he should be reported truthfully. This feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span>
was undoubtedly very strong with him from the day
when he wrote anonymous appreciations of the <i>Leaves</i>
in the New York press.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>Talk turned sometimes to the Washington days, to
Lincoln&rsquo;s yearning passion for the South, to the affectionate
admiration felt by the Union veterans for the
men and boys who fought under Lee, and to the terrible
rigidity of the Southern pride. Such talk would often
end in reminiscences of the hospitals; and Whitman
told his friend that he would like him to cut a bas-relief
showing Walt seated by a soldier&rsquo;s cot in the wards.
It had been his most characteristic pose, if one may use
the word; and such a study would have shown him at
his own work, the work in which he was most at home,
surrounded by the boys who were his flesh and blood.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;GOOD-BYE, MY FANCY&rdquo;</p>


<p class="p2">During the first years of his sojourn among them,
some of the young men of Camden had founded
a Walt Whitman Club;<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> and year by year a group
of intimate friends was springing up about his own
door.</p>

<p>Chief of these was Mr. Horace Traubel, whose life
became so inextricably interwoven with Whitman&rsquo;s last
years that he has rightly been called the old poet&rsquo;s
spiritual son. He was one of the first of Walt&rsquo;s Camden
acquaintances. How or when they met, neither
could remember; looking back to the summer evenings
when the lame, white-haired man and the fair lad sat
together on the steps of the Stevens Street house, it
seemed as though they had always been friends.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>Another of the group was Mr. T. B. Harned,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
Traubel&rsquo;s brother-in-law, an able lawyer and lover of
books, whose house became a second home for Whitman
after the removal from Philadelphia of his friends
the Pearsall Smiths. These two gentlemen, with Dr.
Bucke, eventually became Whitman&rsquo;s executors; better
than anything else, this shows the confidence which
their old friend reposed in them.</p>

<p>On his sixty-ninth birthday&mdash;Friday, 31st May, 1888&mdash;his
Camden friends and others met him at dinner at
Mr. Harned&rsquo;s.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> Two days later he was there again, and
Dr. Bucke, arriving unexpectedly, was of the party.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span></p>
<p>Walt had come in his carriage, and afterwards drove
the doctor to the ferry. Thence he made his way to a
point where, urging his horse into the river, he had
nothing but water and sky before him, all filled with
the sunset glory. He sat for an hour absorbing it in a
sort of ecstasy.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>Returning home, he felt that he had been chilled,
and recognised intimations of a paralytic attack&mdash;the
seventh&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> as he went to bed. He quietly resisted this
alone. In the morning he had two more slight strokes,
and for the first time temporarily lost the power of
speech.</p>

<p>This was Monday, and all through the week he lay
close to death. Dr. Bucke had returned, his friends
entertaining no hopes of his recovery. But the end
was not yet.</p>

<p>Even in the midst of the uncertainty he was determined
to complete the work he had in hand. Every
day he contrived to get downstairs, and every evening
he turned over the proof-sheets of a new volume, which
Horace Traubel brought with him from the printer&rsquo;s
on his way back from the city. From this time on,
Traubel was his daily visitor, his faithful and assiduous
aid.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>Slowly the old man began again to improve, but he
never regained the lost ground. His friends found
him paler than of old, with new lines on his face, and
a heavier expression of weariness.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> The horse and
carriage were no longer of service, and had to be sold;
in the autumn a nurse and wheel-chair took their place.
The increased confinement troubled him most of all, so
that he became jealous of the tramp with his outdoor
life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i326.png" width="600" height="761" alt="Hand written text from two postcards which Whitman sent to Mrs. Berenson, 1887-1888." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">FAC-SIMILES OF POST-CARDS FROM WHITMAN TO MRS. BERENSON, 1887-8</p></div>
</div>

<p>Altogether, as he wrote to his friends, though holding
the fort&mdash;&ldquo;sort o&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;he was &ldquo;a pretty complete
physical wreck&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> O&rsquo;Connor, too, was now paralysed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
and near his end; the two old friends, similarly stricken,
were once again exchanging greetings, though separated
now by a whole continent. In O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s case, however,
the brain itself was also giving way. Walt
followed all the illness of him who had been in some
respects his best comrade with pathetic interest, until,
returning from California to Washington, the broken
flesh gave freedom at last to the man&rsquo;s fiery spirit.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman grew somewhat more querulous in these
later days, with the increase of pain and discomfort;<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>
for from this time on one may almost say that he was
slowly dying. Not that he complained or was inconsiderate,
but little things caused him greater irritation,
though only for a moment.</p>

<p>Nothing is more notable in Whitman&rsquo;s nature than
the short duration of his fits of quick-flaming wrath.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
They flashed out from him in a sudden word, and
passed, leaving no trace of bitterness or resentment
behind.</p>

<p>An example of this is afforded by his behaviour toward
the unexpected and vehement assault upon him by a
former admirer, Mr. Swinburne. Having once acclaimed
Whitman as the <i>cor cordium</i> of the singers of freedom,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
he now consigned him to the category of the Tuppers;
opining that, with a better education, he might perhaps
have attained to a rank above Elliott the Corn-Law
rhymer, but below the laureate Southey. According to
Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s revised estimate, Whitman was in
short no true poet; and as for his ideal of beauty, it
was not only vulgar but immoral. The attack roused
Whitman to snap out, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the damnedest simulacrum?&rdquo;
but that was all.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> The affair was dismissed,
and he only regretted that, for his own sake, Swinburne
had not risen higher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>The rather contemptuous reference to Whitman&rsquo;s
deficient education recalls the first criticism passed
upon the <i>Leaves</i>. Their author was gravely commended
to the study of Addison,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> and to tell the truth, this has
been about the last word of a large number of academic
persons from that day to this. Their advice, when
acted upon, nearly ruined Robert Burns; it had little
effect upon Whitman, though it was not neglected.</p>

<p>But Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s attack reminds one also of something
more important even than &ldquo;Addison&rdquo;; the antithesis
and opposition which exists between two great
orders of poets, of which his friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti
and Whitman himself may be taken as the types.
The <i>Blessed Damozel</i> is in another world from any
page of the <i>Leaves</i>; and there is almost nothing which
the two poets seem to share. Mr. Swinburne did good
service, in so far as he pointed the contrast; but he confused
it by declaiming against the prophet, and extolling
the sonneteer.</p>

<p>The field may not so be limited; the exile of Byron,
Emerson and Carlyle from the brotherhood of poets,
though proclaimed by Mr. Swinburne, can hardly be
enforced. For as Whitman has suggested,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> there are,
inevitably, two kinds of great poetry: one corresponding,
as it were, to the song of the Nightingale, and another
to the flight of the Eagle. He himself has nothing of
the infinitely allusive grace of the former, the sonnet-twining
interpreters of the romantic past, the painters
of subtle dream-beauties and fair women whose faces are
the faces of unearthly flowers wrought purely of the passions
of dead men.</p>

<p>But they again have nothing of his appeal to the heroic
and kingly spirit that confronts the equally romantic
future, grappling with world-tragedies and creating the
new beauty of passions hitherto unborn. Doubtless
the greatest poets unite these two orders, reconciling
them in their own persons; but such are the very
greatest of all time. I do not think that Whitman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
himself would have admitted a claim on his behalf to

<p>The sheets he had been correcting with Traubel&rsquo;s aid,
in the crisis of his illness, were those of <i>November Boughs</i>,
a volume composed, like <i>Two Rivulets</i>, of prose and verse.
It appeared in November, 1888. Among its prose
papers are sympathetic studies of Burns and of Elias
Hicks, with an appreciation of George Fox.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> There
are also many reminiscences, notably of the Old Bowery
Theatre, and of New Orleans; and most interesting
of all, a biographical study of the origins and purpose of
the <i>Leaves</i> themselves.</p>

<p>This <i>Backward Glance o&rsquo;er Travel&rsquo;d Roads</i><a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> has far more
of modesty in it than his earlier writings, which were
necessarily occupied with self-assertion. In his old age
he shows himself a little alarmed at his more youthful
readiness to take up the challenge which he had seen
Democracy and Science throwing down to Poetry. He
recognises with clearer vision than many of his friends,
his own weakness in poetic technique, and the experimental
nature of his work in poetry. But he does not
pretend to doubt its importance; for, as he avers, it is
the projection of a new and American attitude of mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
He is not without confidence also, that his book will
prove a comfort to others, since it has been the main
comfort of his own solitary life&mdash;and he believes it will
be found a stimulus to the American nation of his love.</p>

<p>The poems of the new collection are all brief and
many of them are descriptive. For the rest, they are
mainly the assertions of a jocund heart defying the ice-cold,
frost-bound winter of old-age, and waiting for the
sure-following spring. Meanwhile, he enjoys the inner
mysteries, and the enforced quiet of these later days,
these starry nights; living, as he quaintly says, in &ldquo;the
early candlelight of old-age&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> To him they sometimes
seem to be the best, the halcyon days of all.</p>

<p>He often reviews his past, so seemingly purposeless
and incoherent, and yet so profoundly urged from its
source within toward the unseen goal. Still before
him, he sees endless vistas of the eternal purpose. The
secret souls of things speak to him; the restless sea
betrays the unsatisfied passion of the Earth&rsquo;s great
heart;<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> the rain bears love back with it to the mountains
whence it came.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Everything instructs him, for he remains
eager to learn&mdash;criticism and rejection at least as
much as acceptance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sometimes the long process of dying&mdash;the painfully
prolonged separating of a Body and Soul which were
more intimately wedded than are others&mdash;leaves its
mark upon the page; as in a brief note where he states
simply that his solemn experiences at this period are
unlikely to occur in any other human life.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> He felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span>
himself solitary even in his pain. But this was a solitude
hallowed and supported by the Everlasting Arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Though often sleepless and suffering, he kept, upon
the whole, a cheery business about him, working to the
end. But silence now predominated in his days, and
his craving for it increased. In the evening, Traubel
would come in and sit beside him, watching his face
profiled against the evening light. He had grown to
feel the old man&rsquo;s mood, and had learnt to say nothing.
After an hour or two he had his reward; Walt would
bid him good-bye with a smile, saying, &ldquo;What a good
talk we&rsquo;ve had&rdquo;. For neither of them wanted words.</p>

<p>Through the winter and spring of 1888 to 1889 he
remained house-tied, anchored in his big chair by the
fire; &ldquo;every month letting the pegs lower,&rdquo; he wrote
to his friends.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> But in June he got out and about in
his wheel-chair, and in August crossed the ferry to
be photographed, immensely delighted at the evidences
of gaiety and prosperity which met him everywhere.
America, he would say, is laying great material foundations;
the sky-climbing towers will arise in good time.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHITMAN AT SEVENTY</p></div>
</div>

<p>The birthday dinner, which he did not altogether
approve,<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> became this year a public function, and was
held in the largest of the Camden halls.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> He was
seventy, and the day was but doubtfully propitious.
However, he would not disappoint his friends, and
arrived when the meal was over.</p>

<p>He looked weary, as well he might, but the human
contact and the atmosphere of love and fellowship
warmed and refreshed him. The messages of congratulation
came from far and from many, from William
Morris among the rest. Walt wore a black coat, which
was almost unprecedented, and hid himself behind a
great bowl of flowers, enjoying their colour and scent,
sipping at his champagne, and tapping applause with
the bottle whenever he approved a sentiment. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[Pg 332]</span>
remembers how he used to detest and escape from all
lionising, and to-night, after the praises and the enthusiasm
were concluded, he said laughingly to his
nurse that it was very well, but there was too much
&ldquo;gush and taffy&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>That spring he had been too ill to celebrate the
Lincoln anniversary, but in the following, after a
struggle with influenza, he delivered it for the last&mdash;the
thirteenth&mdash;time.</p>

<p>Hoarse and half-blind, he crossed the river,<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> assisted
everywhere by willing hands, and with great difficulty
climbed the long stairs to the room on South Broad
Street, where Horace Traubel&rsquo;s Contemporary Club
held its meetings. Refusing introduction, he took his
seat on the platform, put on his glasses, and got immediately
to business, reading with a melodious voice
and easy manner.</p>

<p>He was over in the city again for his next birthday
celebration, and after the dinner, Colonel Ingersoll made
a long, impassioned tribute to his friend.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The comradeship
between them was strong and satisfying to both;
Whitman was always in better spirits after a call from
the colonel. &ldquo;He is full of faults and mistakes,&rdquo; he
said once to an English friend, &ldquo;but he is an example
in literature of natural growth as a tree&rdquo;; adding, &ldquo;he
gives out always from himself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p>Their attitude toward questions of religion was often
antagonistic, and on this occasion, after the speech,
Whitman made a sort of rejoinder. While gratefully
acknowledging his friend&rsquo;s appreciation of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>,
he pointed out that Ingersoll had stopped short of the
main matter, for the book was crammed with allusions
to immortality, and was bound together by the idea of
purpose, resident in the heart of all and realising itself in
the material universe. He turned to Ingersoll, demanding,
&ldquo;Unless there is a definite object for it all, what,
in God&rsquo;s name, is it all for?&rdquo; And Ingersoll, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
his head, replied, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell. And if there is a purpose,
and if there is a God, what is it all for? I can&rsquo;t tell.
It looks like nonsense to me, either way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this intellectual agnosticism no argument could
dislodge a mind like Ingersoll&rsquo;s, for noble as it was, it
was limited by its own logic, and to logic alone, working
with the material of merely intellectual knowledge, the
universe must inevitably remain a riddle. Whitman,
recognising a more perfect faculty of reason, and
cognisant of a field of transcendent knowledge which
Ingersoll had never known, was able to realise a purpose
in this, which to Ingersoll seemed only nonsense.</p>

<p>For the divinely creative imagination, when it is
awakened, discovers in all things the meanings of
creative thought. And personality, when in its supreme
hours it transcends the limitations of human knowledge,
and enters the consciousness of the Whole, discovers
the meaning of immortality, and the indestructibility of
the soul. Such flights are naturally impossible to the
pedestrian faculties of the mind.</p>

<p>Ingersoll spoke again in Philadelphia, in the same
vein and on the same subject, in October.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> He had a
large audience of perhaps two thousand persons in the
Horticultural Hall, and Whitman was present on the
platform.</p>

<p>Taking up his subject somewhat in the manner of
O&rsquo;Connor in the <i>Good Gray Poet</i>, the orator denounced
the hypocrisy and parochialism of American opinion,
and proclaimed the Divine right of the liberator, genius.
He justified &ldquo;Children of Adam,&rdquo; and gave in his adherence
to the theory of free rhythm which is exemplified
in the <i>Leaves</i>.</p>

<p>Alluding to the subject of their discussion after the
recent dinner at Reisser&rsquo;s, he declared it impossible for
him to make any assertion of immortality; but admitted
that Hope, replying to the question of Love over the
grave, might proclaim that &ldquo;before all life is death, and
after death is life&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>After the fine, but, in cold type at least, the over-florid
peroration descriptive of the atmosphere of Whitman&rsquo;s
work, the applause was dying away, and the people
rising to go, when the old poet signalled for them to be
detained, and saying that he was there himself to offer
the final testimony to and explanation of his writings,
if they would look at him and understand, he gave
thanks to them and to the orator, and bade them all
farewell.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<img src="images/i334.jpg" width="461" height="800" alt="Picture of Robert G. Ingersoll." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ROBERT G. INGERSOLL, FROM A PRINT</p></div>
</div>

<p>The whole scene presents a curiously suggestive picture.
And Whitman&rsquo;s situation was a most singular
one. His friends had arranged a benefit lecture on the
<i>Leaves</i> by the most eloquent eulogist in America. It is
true the book is not identical with Whitman, but it
would be difficult to separate the <i>Leaves</i> from the man.
And here was the man, apparently of his own free will,
receiving the eulogy and applause in person and the
gate-money by deputy.</p>

<p>The pious Philadelphians had expressed their disapproval
of the lecturer,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> his iconoclastic fervour and
agnosticism, by refusing him the use of the most commodious
hall, and their opposition had encouraged Walt
to stand at his friend&rsquo;s side. But apart from this, his
presence illustrates some of the characteristics of his
nature, his child-like and sometimes terrible love of
directness in the relations of life, and his frank eagerness
for appreciation.</p>

<p>We have seen already that he could learn from
criticism, and there is a story of Dr. Bucke&rsquo;s which is
too good to omit, though it entails a slight digression.
It was against the awkwardness, not the severity, of
his literary surgeons that he would protest with a quiet
humour. After one of their operations, more painful
than usual, in his slow, slightly nasal drawl, he related
how a Quaker was once set on by a robber in a wood.
The fellow knocked his passive victim to the ground,
rifled him thoroughly, and &ldquo;pulling out a long knife
proceeded to cut his throat. The knife was dull, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
patience of the poor Quaker almost exhausted. &lsquo;Friend,&rsquo;
said he to the robber, &lsquo;I do not object to thee cutting
my throat, but thee haggles.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>But while accepting blame with serenity, he yet preferred
praise; understanding praise above all, though
even ignorant praise was hardly unwelcome. Praise
not directly of himself, be it understood&mdash;that often made
him uncomfortable;<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> but of the book, his <i>alter ego</i>, his
child. For the book was, besides, a Cause, and that the
noblest; and even vain applauding of it sounded, in the
old man&rsquo;s ears, like the tramp of the hosts of progress;
in whose ranks there must needs follow, let us admit, a
number of enthusiastic fools.</p>

<p>Of such, certainly, Ingersoll was not one. He saw in
the book much of what Whitman had put there; and
especially he understood how it had been written under
the stress of an emotion which finds its symbol in that
banner of the blue and stars, which he so happily described
as &ldquo;the flag of Nature&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>Other men have given themselves out to be a Christ, or
a John the Baptist, or an Elijah; Whitman, without
their fanaticism, but with a profound knowledge of himself,
recognised in a peasant-born son of Mannahatta, an
average American artisan, the incarnation of America
herself. &ldquo;He is Democracy,&rdquo; quoth Thoreau;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> and
when he sat with a pleased indifference under the
eloquent stream of Ingersoll&rsquo;s panegyric, he was only
testifying anew to his whole-hearted, glad willingness
to give himself, body and mind, for the interpretation of
America to her children. But none the less, it was a
singular situation; and, doubtless, Whitman, who was
not by any means obtuse, felt it to be such.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His last birthday dinner was held in the lower room
at Mickle Street after a winter of illness&mdash;&ldquo;the main
abutments and dykes shattered and threatening to give
out&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>&mdash;broken by an occasional saunter in his wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>chair
with the welcome sight of some four-masted
schooner on the river, and by the visits of his friends.</p>

<p>He was still himself, however. An English admirer
had recently been astounded to find the irrepressible
attractive power of the old man.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> He was brought
downstairs, weak, after a bad day, to meet some thirty
of his friends.</p>

<p>Walt himself started the proceedings with a toast to
the memory of Bryant, Emerson and Longfellow, and to
Tennyson and Whittier, living yet;<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> for the fact that
Whittier strongly disapproved of the <i>Leaves</i> in no way
separated him from Whitman&rsquo;s affectionate esteem.
Rejoicing over his big family gathering, he wistfully
remembered the absent. Doyle had not been to the
house for many months.<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Perhaps he was a little
jealous of new friends, and resented even being thought
of as a stranger by Mrs. Davis. O&rsquo;Connor was dead,
and so was Mrs. Gilchrist, and there were many others
not less dear. Some who were far away sent their
greetings, Tennyson and Symonds among the rest; and
there were the usual warm congratulatory speeches.</p>

<p>The host was sometimes absent-minded, and sometimes,
according to the record, oddly garrulous. But
the talk about the table was often of the deepest interest.
Dr. Bucke was present, and Whitman and he had a
friendly bout over <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. The poet would not
accept the doctor&rsquo;s interpretation, or indeed, any other&rsquo;s,
saying that the book must have its own way with its
readers. It was simply the revelation of the man himself,
&ldquo;the personal critter,&rdquo; as he would phrase it.</p>

<p>Dr. Bucke made some interesting reference to the
elements of evil passion which he detected in his old
friend&rsquo;s make-up; &ldquo;the elements of a Cenci or an
Attila&rdquo;. And Whitman quite simply admitted that he
was not sure that he understood himself.</p>

<p>A touch of humour was never long absent where
Whitman was found. Some audacious devotee asked
him why he had never married; and Walt rambled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span>
off into an explanation, which, after alluding to the
&ldquo;Nibelungen&mdash;or somebody&mdash;&rsquo;s cat with an immensely
long, long, long tail to it,&rdquo; and again to the obscurities
that confront the biographer of Burns, concluded that
the matter in question was probably by no means discreditable,
though inexplicable enough, except in the
light of his whole life.</p>

<p>The questioner remained standing&mdash;he was very enthusiastic&mdash;and
had more to follow. But as he began
to recite &ldquo;Captain! my Captain!&rdquo; a stray dog which
had entered at the open door provided a melancholy and
irresistible accompaniment, convulsing those present in
their own despite until the tears ran down their cheeks.<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a></p>

<p>Finally, Whitman made an interesting political statement.
He condemned as false the protectionist idea of
&ldquo;America for the Americans&rdquo;; and asserted as the
basic political principle, the interdependence of all
peoples, and their openness to one another for purposes
of exchange. The common people of all races are embarked
together like fellows on a ship, he said; what
wrecks one, wrecks all. The ultimate truth about the
human race is its solidarity of interest. Then he was
tired, and calling for his stick and his nurse, he blessed
them all and went slowly upstairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the last of his birthday dinners. He was
seventy-two, very old in body, and very weary. But
he was still bright and affectionate toward the friends
who continued to come great distances to greet him.
A group at Bolton sent two representatives in the years
1890 and 1891, whose records of their visits are suffused
with wonder at the old poet&rsquo;s courtesy and loving consideration
and comradely demonstrations of personal
feeling.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> He was a little anxious lest his English
friends should misapprehend his character: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let
them think of me as a saint or a finished anything,&rdquo;
was the burden of his messages to them, always accompanied
by his love.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span></p>
<p>He spoke warmly of the English, comparing them
favourably at times with their cousins across the sea,
and saying that they represented the deeper and more
lasting qualities of the Anglo-Saxon race; they were like
the artillery of its army.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> The welcome from English
readers had astonished and delighted him. In 1887 he
contemplated a visit to Great Britain;<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and he sometimes
seems even to have toyed with the idea of an
English home. One can be more Democratic there than
in America, he had once declared.<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>Of his own later years, he said to Mr. J. W. Wallace,
who called frequently during the late autumn of 1891,
&ldquo;I used to feel ... that I was to irradiate or emanate
buoyancy and health. But it came to me in time, that
I was not to attempt to live to the reputation I had, or
to my own idea of what my programme should be; but
to give out and express what I really was; and, if I felt
like the devil, to say so; and I have become more and
more confirmed in this.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Whitman has so often been
accused of a self-conscious pose, that this partial acknowledgment
that such a pose had existed is full of interest;
an interest accentuated by the statement that he deliberately
abandoned it in his later years.</p>

<p>Talking was at this time often an effort; the heavy
feeling in his head, which had become more and more
frequent since his first illness, increased till he compared
his brain to &ldquo;sad dough,&rdquo; or &ldquo;an apple dumpling&rdquo;. At
times, when he was really prostrated, his head was &ldquo;like
ten devils&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>The portrait prefixed to his last little book, is that of
some patriarch, bent under a world-weight of experience.
The volume, <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Goodbye">Good-bye</span>, my Fancy</i>, appeared in the winter&mdash;sixty
pages of fragmentary notes and rhythms of pathetic
interest. He called them his &ldquo;last chirps&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> It opens
on a rather deprecatory note, but is touched here and
there with wistful humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>The preface,<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> written two summers before, describes
him as moved by the sunshine to the playfulness of a
kid, a kitten or a frolicsome wave. He finds a grim
satisfaction even in his present state, counting it as a
part of his offering to the cause of the Union and
America, for he has no doubt of its origin in the strain
of the war-years. Of the war, and of his part in it, he
now sees all his <i>Leaves</i> as reminiscent.</p>

<p>The prose memoranda are principally memorial of old
friends, and familiar books and places, and are full of
those generous appreciations which were a delightful
feature of his later life. Among others, are tributes to
Queen Victoria, to his friend Tennyson, and to the great
American poets.<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<p>He returns again to his gospel of health,<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> as the
message most needed in the world to-day; a message
which would contrast with the cry of Carlyle or of
Heine, or of almost any of the dwellers in that Europe
which he sees afar off, as a sort of vast hospital or
asylum ward. It has been his own single purpose to
arouse the soul, the essential giver of Divine health, in
his readers. His aim has always been religious; he
foresees the coming of a new religion which shall
embrace both the feminine beauty of Christianity and
the masculine splendour of Paganism.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<p>The poems are still in the vein of <i>November Boughs</i>.
They are the utterance of certain belated elements in
his life-experience, without which his book would be incomplete.
Some review his past; others anticipate his
future.</p>

<p>The most important is the poem &ldquo;To the Sunset
Breeze,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> which is perhaps the highest expression of his
mystical attitude toward nature. The breeze brings to
this lonely, sick man, incapable of movement, the infinite
message of God and of the world; it comes to him as a
loving and holy companion, the distillation and essence
of all material things, the most godly of spirits:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Thou, messenger-magical strange bringer to body and spirit of me,</div>
<div class="verse">(Distances balk&rsquo;d&mdash;occult medicines penetrating me from head to foot),</div>
<div class="verse">I feel the sky, the prairies vast&mdash;I feel the mighty northern lakes,</div>
<div class="verse">I feel the ocean and the forest&mdash;somehow I feel the globe itself swift-swimming in space;</div>
<div class="verse">Thou blown from lips so loved, now gone&mdash;haply from endless store, God-sent,</div>
<div class="verse">(For thou art spiritual, Godly, most of all known to my sense),</div>
<div class="verse">Minister to speak to me, here and now, what word has never told, and cannot tell,</div>
<div class="verse">Art thou not universal concrete&rsquo;s distillation? Law&rsquo;s, all Astronomy&rsquo;s last refinement?</div>
<div class="verse">Hast thou no soul? Can I not know, identify thee?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>One cannot doubt the feeling behind these passionate
lines, or question the soul-contact which the old poet
felt with the things we are complacently and ignorantly
contented to regard as mere automata, moved by
mechanical force. For Whitman, Nature was a soul;
a soul, though strange and often seeming-hostile, yet
beloved and really loving; a soul, whose infinite life
is, without exception, seeking and groping after its
divine source. He deliberately enumerates a catalogue
of things evil to make the significance of his meaning
clear.</p>

<p>The title of the book is related, on the last page,
to a curious thought which occupied his mind at this
period. While the imagination which has prompted all
his poems has not been exactly himself, it has become so
intimately related to him that he cannot now conceive of
himself existing after death unaccompanied by it; hence
his <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Goodbye">Good-bye</span>, my Fancy</i> is but a new welcome, a <i>vale
atque ave</i>.<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>There are two more poems, not included in this volume,
which seem to close his work. One, the last thing that
he composed, was a final greeting to Columbus, who had
become in his mind a type of the poet of the future.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>The other, the last that I can note of these &ldquo;concluding
chirps,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> as he would call them, is a beautiful correction
of the popular picture of death&rsquo;s valley. Before
Whitman&mdash;and he of all men had a right to speak upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span>
the subject, because he knew Death, as it were, personally&mdash;there
spread out a very different landscape:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Of the broad blessed light and perfect air, with meadows, rippling tides, and trees and flowers and grass,</div>
<div class="verse">And the low hum of living breeze&mdash;and in the midst God&rsquo;s beautiful eternal right hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Thee, holiest minister of Heaven&mdash;thee, envoy, usherer, guide at last of all,</div>
<div class="verse">Rich, florid, loosener of the stricture-knot call&rsquo;d life,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet, peaceful, welcome Death.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As his book-making thus drew to a finish, he occupied
himself with his own tomb. This was being erected
through the autumn of 1891 among the young beeches
and hickories of a new cemetery, a few miles out of
Camden. It was built of grey granite into the bank,
and framed after a well-known design of Blake&rsquo;s.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>At once plain but impressive, it is strikingly different
from the poor little cottage in which he died. And the
fact illustrates again Whitman&rsquo;s simple acceptance of
realities. He knew that his grave must be a place of
pilgrimage; and having brought the bones of his father
and mother to lie beside his own, he gave all possible
dignity, for the sake of the book and the cause, to this
his last resting-place.</p>

<p>While he was thus spending a considerable sum upon
his tomb, the extra expenses entailed by his prolonged
illness were being met, unknown to him, by the generosity
of his Camden friends. After his death, his
executors were surprised to find that there was in
the bank a considerable reserve,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> amounting to several
hundred pounds, available for distribution between his
sisters and his brother Edward, according to the terms
of his will.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In mid-December, 1891, Whitman&rsquo;s right lung became
congested, and when Dr. Bucke arrived on the 22nd the
death-rattle had already been heard, and his immediate
passing was anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span></p>
<p>At Christmas, John Burroughs came over, and found
such an unconquered look upon the sufferer&rsquo;s face that
the thought of death&rsquo;s nearness seemed impossible.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
From St. Louis came Jessie Whitman, her father,
Jefferson, having died a year earlier; and the colonel
brother, who seems now to have removed from Camden,
spent at least one anxious night in the little house. Mr.
Johnston also came over from New York for a last sight
of his old friend. But even with those nearest to him,
interviews became more and more difficult. He longed
for the solitude and silence which their love found it
hardest to give.</p>

<p>The wintry days at the junction of the years went
by in suffering and patience. Walt was affectionately
grateful for the intimate services of his nurse and of
Horace Traubel; writing of the latter as &ldquo;unspeakably
faithful&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Though he was generally calm he was
longing for death. He had dreadful hiccoughs, and
grew colder and more emaciated. The suffering had
become terrible, and the anticipation of its long continuance
brought fear for the first time to his strong
heart.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 551px;">
<img src="images/i342.jpg" width="551" height="800" alt="Picture of Horace Traubel at forty-five." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HORACE TRAUBEL AT FORTY-FIVE</p></div>
</div>

<p>In mid-January, however, he rallied. The Fritzinger
baby was born and called after him, and Walt had it
brought in to be fondled upon his breast.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> Colonel
Ingersoll called, and his magnetic spontaneous presence
and words of profound affection comforted and sustained
his friend. Then, to his great satisfaction, the tenth
edition of his works appeared,<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> and special copies were
forwarded to his friends. He contrived to write brief notes
to Dr. Bucke and to his favourite sister, telling them of
the publication and of his condition.</p>

<p>On the 6th and 7th of February he wrote a last
pathetic letter, which was lithographed and sent out
to many correspondents. The &ldquo;little spark of soul&rdquo;
which, according to his own quaint version of a favourite
saying of Epictetus, had during all these months been
&ldquo;dragging a great lummux of corpse-body clumsily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>
and fro around,&rdquo; was still glimmering. His friends
were ever faithful, he says, and for his bodily state, &ldquo;it
is not so bad as you might suppose, only my sufferings
much of the time are fearful&rdquo;. And he added, as a last
dictum, the substance of his latest public thoughts&mdash;for
he read the newspapers constantly to the last&mdash;&ldquo;more
and more it comes to the fore, that the only theory
worthy our modern times, for great literature, politics
and sociology, must combine all the best people of all
lands, the women not forgetting&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<p>His friend over-sea, Addington Symonds, was ill and
depressed,<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> and George Stafford passed away at Glendale.
He became yet more silent; looked over his
letters and the journals; took and relished his brandy-punch
and slept. Almost daily his pain increased, and
the choking mucus. He was often in terrible exhaustion,
and the long nights were almost unbearable.
&ldquo;Dear Walt,&rdquo; said his faithful friend, as he bent down
and kissed him, &ldquo;you do not realise what you have been
to us&rdquo;; and Walt rejoined feebly, &ldquo;nor you, what you
have been to me&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>All through March the restlessness and agony increased.
There seemed to be no parcel of his emaciated
body which was not the lurking place of pain. The
stubborn determination of his nature suffered the last
throes of human agony before it would surrender. Thus
he learnt the lesson of death as few have ever learnt
it.</p>

<p>Those who watched could do little but love him, and
for that his dim eyes repaid them a thousandfold to the
end. Without, the days were dismally bleak; snow lay
heavily upon the earth, but in the big three-windowed
room winter seemed still more fierce and dread.</p>

<p>On the night of the 24th he was moved on to a water
bed, which eased him. He tried to laugh when, as he
turned him upon it and the water splashed around,
Warry, the sailor-nurse, said it sounded like the waves
upon a ship&rsquo;s flanks. The thought was full of sugges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>tions
and chimed with his own; but the mucus choked
him into silence.</p>

<p>Next day he was terribly weak, but restful, and that
night he slept and seemed easier. On the following
afternoon they saw that at last he was surrendering.
He smiled and felt no longer any pain.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Warry moved
him for the last time about six o&rsquo;clock, and Walt acknowledged
the change with gratitude. Half an hour
later, holding Traubel&rsquo;s hand in his, he lapsed silently
into the Unknown.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, and the rain fell softly bearing
its burden of love to the earth, and dripping from the
eaves upon the side-walk. The noble ship had slipt
its cable and gone forth upon &ldquo;the never-returning
tide&rdquo;.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitman died on a Saturday night. On the Wednesday
following, from eleven to two, the Mickle Street
house was invaded by thousands of people of every age
and class, who had come to take a last look at the
familiar face. &ldquo;It was the face of an aged, loving
child,&rdquo; said one of them.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Among the rest came an old Washington comrade,<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
who was unrecognised by the policeman keeping order
at the little door. No, said he, it is late, and the house
is full already. With a bitter and broken heart, he was
turning away bewildered from the place, when one of
the others saw him and, heartily calling his name, led
him in.</p>

<p>How many, many thoughts surged through his brain,
as he looked on that dear face, and poignantly remembered
again the old days! How he reproached himself
for the long lapses that had crept of late, half-observed,
into their intimacy! Why had he not been here these
months past, nursing and caring for one who had been
dearer to him than his father? Why had he left him in
his last agonies to hired helpers, however kind, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
new friends. Surely, he thought, the old are dearer&mdash;if
they be true.</p>

<p>He went out with the crowd to Harleigh, saw the
strange ceremony, and heard, without understanding
them, the fine words spoken. And then, refusing to be
comforted, he escaped, walking home alone along the
dusty roads&mdash;alone forever now&mdash;the tears coursing
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>But come! he would no longer waste the hours in
vain reproaches. Walt, after all, understood. He had
always understood, and felt the depth of love that sometimes
seeks so false an expression in jealousy. Come
now, he will live henceforward by the thought and in the
unclouded love of his old Walt, once his and his now
forever.</p>

<p>Of course, he had not understood Walt, not as these
scholars, these writers and poets understood him. But
he had been &ldquo;awful near to him, nights and days&rdquo;.
And those letters of his! Sometimes he thought that
in the passion of his young plain manhood, he had come
nearer, yes, nearer than any other, to that great loving
soul. And for my part, I am not sure that he was
mistaken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, in the new cemetery, out along Haddon
Avenue beyond the Dominican Convent where dwell the
Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary, they had buried the
remains of Walt Whitman&rsquo;s body. The hillside above
the pool had been covered with folk; and up on the
beech-spray over the tomb, the first blue-bird had sung
its plaintive-sweet promise of the breaking spring.<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>In the palm-decked white pavilion, with its open sides,
the words of the old poet&rsquo;s Chant of Death had mingled
with those of the Christ and of the Buddha, and with
the half-choked sentences of living lovers and friends.
&ldquo;I felt as if I had been at the entombment of Christ,&rdquo;
writes one; and another murmured, &ldquo;We are at the
summit&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span></p>

<p>But the last words had been spoken by Ingersoll&mdash;&ldquo;I
loved him living, and I love him still&rdquo;.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/i346.jpg" width="800" height="593" alt="Picture of Whitman's tomb at Harleigh Cemetery, 1904." />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE TOMB AT HARLEIGH CEMETERY, 1904</p></div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; writes one who knew him
intimately, &ldquo;I have never had the feeling that Walt
Whitman was dead. I think of him as still there, capable
of writing to me at any time, and my thoughts
often turn to him for his friendly sympathy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>It is incredible that any being who has consciously
entered upon that life of love which approves itself to
the soul as God&rsquo;s own life, can be fundamentally affected
by death. What our life is we know not, nor may we
speak with any confidence of the nature of the change
which we call death; but love we know, and in it, as
Ingersoll rightly guessed, is the key to the riddle of
mortality.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_721_721" id="Footnote_721_721"></a><a href="#FNanchor_721_721"><span class="label">[721]</span></a> I cannot omit some reference to the brilliant and interesting criticism
of Whitman by Mr. George Santayana, especially that contained
in his <i>Poetry and Religion</i>, pp. 175-87, etc., though it is somewhat outside
my proper field.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Santayana, if I understand him aright, regards all mysticism
as a form of spiritual loafing; he heartily discounts the more primal
emotions as being &ldquo;low&rdquo; in the scale of evolution, and sets a correspondingly
high premium upon all that is subtle and complex. Though
he seeks to be just to his victim, his lack of sympathy is clearly evidenced
in the cleverly rhetorical but quite unworthy passage (p. 180)
wherein Whitman is described as having &ldquo;wallowed in the stream of
his own sensibility, as later, at Camden, in the shallows of his favourite
brook&rdquo;. Such phrases may be funny, but I trust the preceding pages
have shown that they are not true to the facts of Whitman&rsquo;s life. To
reply to Mr. Santayana is obviously beyond my scope; and, even if I
could undertake the task, it would entail upon the reader many laborious
pages devoted to the study of æsthetic values. For I suspect, that,
whichever of us may be right, our difference goes back to the beginning.</p></div>

<p class="p2">Whitman himself has described his grandmother,
Naomi Williams, as belonging to the Quaker
Society, but upon inquiry it does not appear that she was
ever a member. She was one of seven sisters; her father,
Captain John Williams, and his only son, died at sea. He
had been part-owner of his vessel, a schooner in the East
Indian trade, plying between New York and Florida, and
in 1767 he was married at Cold Spring, where his father,
Thomas Williams, also a seaman, was living at the same
time.</p>

<p>The name of Thomas Williams occurs elsewhere in the old
records of this district. In 1759 one of this name, who had
a son John, was at Cove Neck, having removed there from
Cold Spring. This Thomas one inclines to identify with the
sea-going grandfather of Naomi, and he was the son of John
Williams and Tamosin Carpenter, of Musketa Cove, whose
name occurs in a document of 1727. I understand that
this John and his son Thomas were Quakers.</p>

<p>Another Captain Thomas Williams, described as &ldquo;of Oyster
Bay,&rdquo; was in 1758 first captain of the Queen&rsquo;s County recruits.
Twenty-one years later, a John Williams and a Daniel
van Velsor were serving as privates in a Long Island troop
of horse, but they do not concern us.</p>

<p>In the absence of any definite information, and in view of
the frequency of the name of Williams throughout this district&mdash;owing
to the fact that Robert and Richard Williams (Welshmen)
settled hereabouts in the middle of the seventeenth century&mdash;one
can only surmise the cause which severed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span>
family of Naomi Williams from the Society. It is possible
that her father married out, thus forfeiting his membership,
according to the old laws of the Society concerning marriage
with a non-member. Or the War of Independence may have
claimed his active participation and thus snapped the bond.
Or, again, circumstances connected with his profession, or
difficulties in attending the meetings for worship, may have
caused his name to be dropped from the lists of membership.
There would seem to be no doubt, however, that his daughter&rsquo;s
sympathies remained with the Friends.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

<p class="center">WHITMAN IN NEW ORLEANS</p>


<p class="p2">Edward Carpenter wrote in the <i>Reformer</i>, February,
1902, p. 89: &ldquo;In a letter to J. Addington Symonds
(19th August, 1890),<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> he [Whitman] mentioned that he had
six children. Symonds, writing to me in 1893, quoted the
passage in question from this letter of Whitman&rsquo;s, and it runs
as follows: &lsquo;My life, young manhood, mid-age, times South,
etc., have been jolly bodily, and doubtless open to criticism.
Tho&rsquo; unmarried I have had six children&mdash;two are dead&mdash;one
living, Southern grandchild, fine boy, writes to me occasionally&mdash;circumstances
(connected with their fortune and benefit)
have separated me from intimate relations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a letter to Carpenter, further attested in conversation
with myself, Horace Traubel says: &ldquo;Walt frequently in his
later years made allusions to the fact of his fatherhood.
That is, to me. One night, just previous to his death, I
went with Harned to Walt&rsquo;s room, at Walt&rsquo;s request, to get
a sort of deposition in the matter, its detail, etc., etc....
But he was taken sick in our presence and was unable to
proceed. There the thing rested ... he ... could never
resume the subject. He wished to have the recital &lsquo;put
away in Harned&rsquo;s safe,&rsquo; as he said, &lsquo;in order that some one
should authoritatively have all the facts at command if by
some misfortune a public discussion of the incident were
ever provoked&rsquo;.... He did not wish the matter broached.
He felt that it would indisputably do a great injury to some
one, God knows who (I do not). During Walt&rsquo;s last sickness
his grandson came to the house. I was not there at
the time. When W. mentioned the occurrence to me I expressed
my regret that I had missed him. &lsquo;I wish I might
see him.&rsquo; &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; [said Whitman]....&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>I was informed in Camden that there were <i>two</i> Southern (?)
ladies, one of whom had died. There was an impression
among my informants that Whitman was explicitly pledged,
by the family of one if not both of these ladies, never to hint at
his relationship to the children. He told Traubel that this
enforced separation was the tragedy of his life. There is a
love-letter extant, signed with a pseudonym, dated from New
York in 1862, evidently written by a cultivated woman. If
the grandchild who called at Mickle Street in 1891 was from
the South&mdash;the correspondent of Symond&rsquo;s letter, as one may
suspect&mdash;it is difficult to put the birth of his father or mother
much later, I think, than 1850. It is noticeable that Whitman
destroyed the references among his papers to the New Orleans
visit, beyond those already printed in his prose works. In a
book of memoranda referring to his early years, now in the
possession of Mr. Harned, I have noted the tearing out of
several leaves after the entry of his starting for New Orleans.
The specification of &ldquo;one living Southern grandchild,&rdquo; and of
four children still living in 1890, suggests the probability that
the second lady was not living in the South.</p>

meaning to the present generation. The editors will not deal, except very subordinately,
with questions of textual criticism or philology; but, taking the English
text in the Revised Version as their basis, they will try to combine a hearty acceptance
of critical principles with loyalty to the Catholic Faith.</p>

<li class="cat2a">&lsquo;The tender reverence of the treatment
and the imaginative beauty of the writing
have reconciled us to the daring of the conception.
This &ldquo;Dream of the World&rsquo;s

paraphrase of the supreme climax of the

<li class="cat">THE SORROWS OF SATAN. <i>Forty-Ninth
Edition. Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></li>

<li class="cat2a">&lsquo;A very powerful piece of work....
The conception is magnificent, and is likely
to win an abiding place within the memory
of man.... The author has immense command
of language, and a limitless audacity....
This interesting and remarkable romance
will live long after much of the ephemeral
literature of the day is forgotten.... A
literary phenomenon ... novel, and even
sublime.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. T. Stead</span> in the <i>Review of

<li class="cat2a">&lsquo;It cannot be denied that &ldquo;The Master
Christian&rdquo; is a powerful book; that it is one
likely to raise uncomfortable questions in all
but the most self-satisfied readers, and that
it strikes at the root of the failure of the
Churches&mdash;the decay of faith&mdash;in a manner
which shows the inevitable disaster heaping
up.... The good Cardinal Bonpré is a
beautiful figure, fit to stand beside the good
Bishop in &ldquo;Les Misérables.&rdquo; It is a book
with a serious purpose expressed with absolute
unconventionality and passion.... And this
is to say it is a book worth reading.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></li>

&ldquo;Temporal Power&rdquo; without becoming convinced

the book was to hold the mirror up to shams,
injustice, dishonesty, cruelty, and neglect
of conscience, nothing but praise can be given
to that intention.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></li>

determined to issue a new series of fiction at a low price under the title of &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Methuen&rsquo;s Strand

quality may be gauged from the names of those authors who contribute the early volumes of
the series.</p>

<p class="smaller">Messrs. Methuen would point out that the books are as good and as long as a six shilling
novel, that they are bound in cloth and not in paper, and that their price is One Shilling <i>net</i>.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
